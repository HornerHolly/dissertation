 Come  balmy Sleep  tired nature soft resort   On these fad temples all thy poppies shed  And bid gay dreams  from Morpheus  airy court  Float in light vision round my aching head  Secure of all thy ble ings  partial Power  On his hard bed the peasant throws him down   And the poor sea boy  in the rudest hour  Enjoys thee more than he who wears a crown  Clasp in her faithful shepherd guardian arms  Well may the village girl sweet slumbers prove  And they  O gentle Sleep  still taste thy charms  Who wake to labour  liberty  and love  But still thy opiate aid dost thou deny To calm the anxious breast  to close the streaming eye
