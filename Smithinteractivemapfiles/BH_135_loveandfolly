  Love  who now deals to human hearts  Such ill thrown  yet resistle  darts  That haple  mortals can t withstand them  Was once le  cruel and perverse  Nor did he then his shafts disperse  So much at random   It happened  that the thoughtle  child Was rambling thro a flowery wild  Like idle lad in school vacation  Where sauntering now  and now at rest  Stroll Folly  who to Love addre  His conversation  On trifles he had much to say  Then laughing he propos to play  And stake against Love  bow his bauble   The quiver gamester smild and won  But testy Folly soon began To fret and squabble  Loud and more loud the quarrel grows  From words the wranglers went to blows  For Folly  rage is prompt to rise   Till bleeding Love a martyr stood A stroke from Folly  weapon rude  Put out his eyes  Then wild with anguish  Venus pray  For vengeance on the idiot  head  And begg of cloud compelling Jove  His swiftest lightening  to destroy  The mischievous malignant boy That blinded Love   Folly is immortal   Jove replied  But  tho  your prayer must be denied    An endle  penance is decreed him    For Love  tho  blind  will reign around   The world   but still where ever found  Folly shall lead him
