GREEN over the copses spring soft hues are
spreading  
High wave the Reeds in the transparent floods  
The Oak its fear and fallow foliage shedding  
From their mossed cradles start its infant buds  
Pale as the tranquil tide of summer ocean  
The Willow now its slender leaf unveils   
And thro   the sky with swiftly fleeting motion  
Driven by the wind   the rack of April fails  

Then   as the gust declines   the stealing showers
Fall fresh and noiseless   while at closing day
The low sun gleams on moist and half  blown flowers
That promise garlands for approaching May  
Blest are yon peasant children   simply singing  
Who thro   the new  sprung grass rejoicing rove  
More blest   to whom the Time   fond thought is bringing  
Of friends expected   or returning love  
The pensive wanderer blest   to whom reflection
Points out some future views that sooth his mind  
Me how unlike    whom cruel recollection
But tells of comfort I shall never find  

Hope   that on Nature youth is still attending  
No more to me her fyren song shall sing   
Never to me her influence extending  
shall I again enjoy the days of spring   
Yet   how I loved them once these scenes remind me  
When light of heart   in childhood thoughtless mirth  
I recked not that the cruel lot assigned me
should make me curse the hour that gave me birth   
Then   from thy wild  wood banks   Aruna   roving  
Thy thymy downs with sportive steps I fought  
And Nature charms   with artless transport loving  
sung like the birds   unheeded and untaught  

But now the springtide pleasant hours returning  
serve to awaken me to sharper pain   
Recalling scenes of agony and mourning  
Of baffled hope and prayers preferred in vain  
Thus shone the sun   his vernal rays displaying  
Thus did the woods in early verdure wave  
While dire Disease on all I loved was preying  
And flowers seemed rising but to strew her grave  
Now     mid reviving blooms   I coldly languish  
spring seems devoid of joy to me alone   
Each sound of pleasure aggravates my anguish  
And speaks of beauty   youth   and sweetness gone   

Yet   as stern Duty bids   with faint endeavour
I drag on life   contending with my woe  
Tho   conscious Misery still repeats   that never
My soul one pleasureable hour shall know  
Lost in the tomb   when Hope no more appeases
The festered wounds that prompt the eternal sigh  
Grief   the most fatal of the heart   diseases  
soon teaches   whom it fastens on   to die  
The wretch undone   for pain alone existing  
The abject dread of Death shall sure subdue  
And far from his decisive hand resisting  
Rejoice to bid a world like this   adieu
