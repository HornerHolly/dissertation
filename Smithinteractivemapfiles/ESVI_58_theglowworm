  WHEN on some balmy breathing night of Spring The happy child  to whom the world is new  Pursues the evening moth  of mealy wing  Or from the heath bell beats the sparkling dew    He sees before his inexperienced eyes  The brilliant Glow worm  like a meteor  shine On the turf bank   amazed  and pleased  he cries    Star of the dewy gra   I make thee mine    Then  ere he sleep  collects the moisten  flower  And bids soft leaves his glittering prize enfold  And dreams that Fairy lamps illume his bower  Yet with the morning shudders to behold His lucid treasure  rayle  as the dust   So turn the World bright joys to cold and blank disgust
