 BORNE on the warm wing of the western gale  How tremulously low is heard to float Thro the green budding thorns that fringe the vale  The early Nightingale prelusive note       Tis Hope instinctive power that thro  the grove Tells how benignant Heaven revives the earth    Tis the soft voice of young and timid love That calls these melting sounds of sweetne  forth    With transport  once  sweet bird   I hail thy lay  And bade thee welcome to our shades again    To charm the wandering poet pensive way And sooth the solitary lover pain  But now    such evils in my lot combine  As shut my languid sense to Hope dear voice and thine
