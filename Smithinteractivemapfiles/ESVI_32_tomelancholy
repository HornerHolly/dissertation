 WHEN latest Autumn spreads her evening veil  And the grey mists from these dim waves arise  I love to listen to the hollow sighs  Thro  the half leaflefs wood that breathes the gale  For at such hours the shadowy phantom  pale  Oft seems to fleet before the poet eyes   Strange sounds are heard  and mournful melodies  As of night wanderers  who their woes bewail  Here  by his native stream  at such an hour  Pity own Otway I methinks could meet  And hear his deep fighs swell the sadden wind  O Melancholy   such thy magic power  That to the soul these dreams are often sweet  And footh the pensive visionary mind
