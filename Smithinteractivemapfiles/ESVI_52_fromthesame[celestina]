 FAULTERING and sad the unhappy Pilgrim roves  Who  on the eve of bleak December night  Divided far from all he fondly loves  Journeys alone  along the giddy height Of these steep cliffs  and as the Sun last ray Fades in the West  fees  from the rocky verge  Dark tempest scowling o er the shortened day  And hears  with ear appallid  the impetuous surge Beneath him thunder   So  with heart oppre id  Alone  reluctant  desolate  and flow  By Friendship  chcering radiance now unblest  Along Life  rudest path I seem to go  Nor see where yet the anxious heart may rest  That  trembling at the past  recoils from future woe
