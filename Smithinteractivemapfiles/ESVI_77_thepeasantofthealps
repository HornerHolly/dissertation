WHERE cliffs arise by winter crown  And thro  dark groves of pine around  Down the deep chasms the snow fed torrents foam  Within some hollow  shelter from the storms  The Peasant of the Alps his cottage forms  And builds his humble  happy home  Unenvied is the rich domain  That far beneath him on the plain Waves its wide harvests and its olive groves   More dear to him his hut with plantain thatch  Where long his unambitious heart attach    Finds all he wishes  all he loves  There dwells the mistre  of his heart  And Love  who teaches every art  Has bid him dre  the spot with fondest care   When borrowing from the vale its fertile foil  He climbs the precipice with patient toil  To plant her favorite flowrets there  With native shrubs  an hardy race  There the green myrtle finds a place  And roses there the dewy leaves decline   While from the craggs abrupt  and tangled steeps  With bloom and fruit the Alpine berry peeps  And  blushing  mingles with the vine  His garden simple produce stored  Prepared for him by hands adored  Is all the little luxury he knows And by the same dear hands are softly spread  The Chamois  velvet spoil that forms the bed  Where in her arms he finds repose  But absent from the calm abode  Dark thunder gathers round his road  Wild raves the wind  the arrowy lightnings flash  Returning quick the murmuring rocks among  His faint heart trembling as he winds along   Alarm he listens to the crash Of rifted ice   Oh  man of woe   O er his dear cot a ma  of snow  By the storm sever from the cliff above  Has fallen and buried in its marble breast  All that for him loft wretch the world po est  His home  his happine   his love  Aghast the heart struck mourner stands  Glazed are his eyes convulsed his hands  Overwhelming anguish checks his labouring breath  Crush by despair intolerable weight  Frantic he seeks the mountain giddiest height  And headlong seeks relief in death  A fate too similar is mine  But I in lingering pain repine  And still my lost felicity deplore   Cold  cold to me is that dear breast become Where this poor heart had fondly fix its home  And love and happine  are mine no more
