November   chill blast on the rough beach is howling  
The surge breaks afar   and then foams to the shore  
Dark clouds over the sea gather heavy and scowling  
And the white cliffs reecho the wild wintry roar  
Beneath that chalk rock   a fair stranger reelining  
Has found on damp sea  weed a cold lonely feat   
Her eyes filled with tears   and her heart with repining  
she starts at the billows that burst at her feet  

There   day after day   with an anxious heart heaving  
she watches the waves where they mingle with air   
For the fail which   alas   all her fond hopes deceiving  
May bring only tidings to add to her care  
Loose stream to wild winds those fair flowing tresses  
Once woven with garlands of gay summer flowers   
Her dress unregarded   bespeaks her distresses  
And beauty is blighted by grief  s heavy hours  
Her innocent children   unconscious of sorrow  
To seek the glossed shell   or the crimson weed stray  
Amused with the present   they heed not tomorrow  
Nor think of the storm that is gathering to day  

The gilt   fairy ship   with its ribbon  fail spreading   
They launch on the falt pool the tide left behind  
Ah   viá»‡tims    for whom their fad mother is dreading  
The multiplied miseries that wait on mankind       
To fair fortune born   she beholds them with anguish  
Now wanderers with her on a once hostile foil  
Perhaps doomed for life in chill penury to languish  
Or abject dependence   or soul  crushing toil  
But the sea  boat   her hopes and her terrors renewing  
over the dim grey horizon now faintly appears  
she flies to the quay   dreading tidings of ruin  
All breathless with hafte   half expiring with fears  

Poor mourner   I would that my fortune had left me
The means to alleviate the woes I deplore  
  
But like thine my hard fate has of affluence bereft me  
I can warm the cold heart of the wretched no more
