 On this lone island  whose unfruitful breast Feeds but the Summer shepherd little flock With scanty herbage from the half clothed rock  Where osprays  cormorants  and sea mews rest  Even in a scene so desolate and rude I could with thee for months and years be blest  And of thy tenderne  and love pofsest  Find all my world in this wild solitude   When Summer suns these Northern seas illume  With thee admire the light reflected charms      And when drear Winter spreads his cheerle  gloom  Still find Elysium in thy sheltring arms   For thou to me canst sovereign bli  impart  Thy mind my empire and my throne thy heart
