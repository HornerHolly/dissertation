HERE from the restless bed of lingering pain
The languid sufferer seeks the tepid wave  
And feels returning health and hope again
Disperse    the gathering shadows of the grave     
And here romantic rocks that boldly swell  
Fringed with green woods   or stained with veins of ore  
Called native Genius forth   whose Heaven  taught skill
Charmed the deep echos of the rifted shore  
But tepid waves   wild scenes   or summer air  
Restore they palsied Fancy   woe  deprest   
Check they the torpid influence of Despair  
Or bid warm Health reanimate the breast  
Where Hope soft visions have no longer part  
And whose fad inmate is a broken heart
