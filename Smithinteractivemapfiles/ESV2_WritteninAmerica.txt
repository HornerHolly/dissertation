ILL omened bird   whose cries portentous float
over yon savannah with the mournful wind  
While   as the Indian hears your piercing note  
Dark dread of future evil fills his mind  
Wherefore with early lamentation break
The dear delusive visions of repose   
Why from so short felicity awake
My wounded senses to substantial woes  
over my fick soul thus roused from transient rest  
Pale superstition sheds her influence drear  
And to my shuddering fancy would suggest
Thou comest to speak of every woe I fear  
Ah   Reason little over the soul prevails  
When   from ideal ill   the enfeebled spirit fails
