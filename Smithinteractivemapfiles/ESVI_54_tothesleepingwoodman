 YE copses wild  where April bids arise The vernal gra es  and the early flowers  My soul depre  from human converse flies To the lone shelter of your pathle  bowers  Lo  where the Woodman  with his toil oppre   His carele  head on bark and mo  reclined  Lull by the song of birds  the murmuring wind  Has sunk to calm tho  momentary rest  Ah  would  twere mine in Spring green lap to find Such transient respite from the ills I bear  Would I could taste  like this unthinking hind  A sweet forgetfulne  of human care  Till the last sleep these weary eyes shall close  And Death receive me to his long repose
