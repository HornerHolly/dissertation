 NYMPH of the rock  whose dauntle  spirit braves The beating storm  and bitter winds that howl Round thy cold breast  and hear st the bursting waves And the deep thunder with unshaken soul   Oh come  and shew how vain the cares that pre  On my weak bosom  and how little worth Is the false fleeting meteor  Happine   That still misleads the wanderers of the earth  Strengthen by thee  this heart shall cease to meltover ills that poor humanity must bear  Nor friends estranged  or ties di olved be felt To leave regret  and fruitle  anguish there   And when at length it heaves its latest sigh  Thou and mild Hope shall teach me how to die
