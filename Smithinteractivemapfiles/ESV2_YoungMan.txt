GO now   ingenuous Youth     The trying hour   
Is come    The World demands that thou shouldst go
To active life    There titles   wealth and power
May all be purchasidYet I joy to know
Thou wilt not pay their price   The base controul
Of petty despots in their pedant reign
Already hast thou felt      and high disdain
Of Tyrants is imprinted on thy soul  
Not   where mistaken Glory   in the field
Rears her red banner   be thou ever found  
But   against proud Oppression raise the shield
Of Patriot daring   so shalt thou renowned
For the best virtues live    or that denied
Mayst die   as Hampden or as sydney died
