 tHE dark and pillowy cloud  the sallow trees  Seem o er the ruins of the year to mourn   And  cold and hollow  the inconstant breeze Sobs thro  the falling leaves and wither fern  O er the tall brow of yonder chalky bourn  The evening shades their gather darkne  fling  While  by the lingering light  I scarce discern The shrieking night jar fail on heavy wing  Ah  yet a little and propitious Spring Crown with fresh flowers shall wake the woodland   strain   But no gay change revolving seasons bring To call forth pleasure from the soul of pain   Bid Syren Hope resume her long lost part  And chase the vulture Care that feeds upon the heart
