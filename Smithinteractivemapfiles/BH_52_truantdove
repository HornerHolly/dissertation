A MOUNTAIN stream  its channel deep Beneath a rock  rough base had torn  The cliff  like a vast castle wall  was steep By fretting rains in many a crevice worn  But the fern way there  and the mo es crept  Ang er the summit  where the wind Peeld from their stems the silver sind  Depending birches wept  There  tufts of broom a footing used to find  And heath and straggling gra  to grow  And half way down from roots enwreathing  broke The branches of a scathed oak  And seem to guard the cave below  Where each revolving year  Their twins  two faithful doves were wont to rear   Choice never join a fonder pair   To each their simple home was dear  No discord ever enter there   But there the soft affections dwelld  And three returning springs beheld Secure within their fortre  high The little happy family    Toujours perdrix  me ieurs  ne valent rien   So did a Gallic monarch once harangue  And evil was the day whereon our bird This saying heard  From certain new acquaintance he had found  Who at their perfect ease  Amid a field of peas Boasted to him  that all the country round  The wheat  and oats  and barley  rye and tares  Quite to the neighbouring sea  were theirs  And theirs the oak  and beech woods  far and near  For their right noble owner was a peer  And they themselves  luxuriantly were stored In a great dove cote to amuse my lord     Toujours perdrix ne valent rien   That  strange  When people once are happy  wherefore change  So thought our stock dove  but communication  With birds in his new friend  exalted station  Whose means of information  And knowledge of all sorts  must be so ample  Who saw great folks  and follow their example  Made on the dweller of the cave  impre ion  And soon  whatever was his best po e ion  His sanctuary within the rock  deep breast  His soft eyed partner  and her nest  He thought of with indifference  then with loathing  So much insipid love was good for nothing  But sometimes tenderne  return  his dame So long belov  so mild  so free from blame  How should he tell her  he had learn to cavil At happine  itself  and longed to travel   His heart still smote him  so much wrong to do her  He knew not how to break the matter to her  But love  tho  blind himself  makes some discerning  His frequent absence  and his late returning  With ruffled plumage  and with alter eyes  His carele  short replies  And to their couplets  coldne  or neglect Had made his gentle wife suspect  All was not right  but she forbore to teaze him  Which would but give him an excuse to rove   She therefore tried by every art to please him  Endur his peevish starts with patient love  And when  like other husbands from a tavern  Of his new notions full  he sought his cavern She with di embled cheerfulne     beguiled   The thing she was   and gaily coo ed and smiled   Tis not in this most motley sphere uncommon  For man   and so of course more feeble woman  Most strongly to suspect  what they re pursuing Will lead them to inevitable ruin  Yet rush with open eyes to their undoing   Thus felt the dove    but in the cant of fashion He talk of fate  and of predestination  And in a grave oration  He to his much affrighted mate related  How he  yet slumbering in the egg  was fated  To gather knowledge  to instruct his kind  By observation elevate his mind  And give new impulse to Columbian life    If it be so   exclaim his haple  wife    It is my fate  to pa  my days in pain    To mourn your love estrang  and mourn in vain     Flere in our once dear hut  to wake and weep    When thy unkindne  shall have  murder sleep   56 And never that dear hut shall I prepare  w And wait with fondne  your arrival there  While me  and mine forgetting  you will go   To some new love     Why  no  I tell you no    What shall I say such foolish fears to cure    I only mean to make a little tour  Just just to see the world around me  then   With new delight  I shall come home again     Such tours are quite the rage at my return   I shall have much to tell  and you to learn     Of fashions some becoming  some grotesque    Of change of empires  and ideas novel    Of buildings  Grecian  Gothic  Arabesque    And scenery sublime and picturesque    And all these things with pleasure we ll discu   Ah  me  and what are all these things to us     So then  you have a bird of genius grovel    And never see beyond a farmer  hovel Even the sand martin  that inferior creature    Goes once a year abroad     It is his nature  66 But yours how different once    and then she sigh    There was a time  Ah  would that I had died   E er you so chang  when you have perish rather   Than this poor breast should heave a single feather   With grief and care  And all this cant of fashion   Would but have rais your anger  or compa ion   O my dear love  You sought not then to range    But on my changeful neck as fell the light    You sweetly said  you wish no other change   Than that soft neck could shew  to berries bright   Of mountain aslı  you fondly could compare My scarlet feet and bill  my shape and air    Ah  faithle  fatterer  did you not declare   The soul of grace and beauty center there  My eyes you said  were opals  brightly pink    Enchas in onyx  and you seem to think    Each charm might then the coldest heart enthrall     Those charms were mine  Alas  I gave you all  Your farthest wanderings then were but to fetch   The pea  the tare  the beechmast  and the vetch    For my repast  within my rocky bower    With spleenwort shaded  and the blue bell  flower    For prospects then you never wish to roam    But the best scenery was our happy home    And when  beneath my breast  then fair and young  u Our first dear pair  our earliest nestlings sprung   And weakly  indistinctly  tried to coo    Were not those moments picturesque to you     Yes  faith  my dear  and all you say is true     Oh  hear me then  if thus we have been blest    If on these wings it was your joy to rest    Love must from habitstill new strength begaining     From habit   tis of that  child  I m complaining    This everlasting fondne  will not be   For birds of flesh and blood  We sha nt agree    So why dispute  now prithee don t torment me    I shall not long be gone  let that content ye    Pshaw  what a fu   Come  no more sighs and groans   Keep up your spirits  mind your little ones   My journey won t be far my honour  pledged I shall be back again before they re fledged    Give me a ki   and now my dear  adieu   So light of heart and plumes  away he flew  And  as above the sheltering rock he springs  She listen to the echo of his wings   Those well known sounds  so soothing heretofore  Which her heart whisper she should hear no more  Then to her cold and widow bed she crept  Clasp her half orphan  young  and wept  Her recreant mate  by other views attracted  A very different part enacted   He sought the dove cote  and was greeted there With all that  tonish  elegant  and rare  Among the pigeon tribes  and there the rover Lived quite in clover  His jolly comrades now  were blades of spirit  Their nymphs po e  most fascinating merit  Nor fail our hero of the rock to prove  Ile thought not of inviolable love To his poor spouse at home  He bow and sigh  Now to a fantail   now a cropper  bride   Then cow ring low to a majestic powter  Declared he should not suffer life without her  And then with upturn  eyes  in phrase still humbler  Implor the pity of an almond tumbler   Next  to a beauteous carrier  feet he run  And lived a week  the captive of a nun  Thus far in measurele  content he revels  And blest the hour when he began his travels  Yet some things soon occurr not quite so pleasant  He had observ that an unfeeling peasant  It silence mounting on a ladder high  Seiz certain pigeons just as they could fly  Who never figur more  but in a pie  That was but aukward  then  his lordship  son Heard from the groom  that  twould be famous fun To try on others his unpractis gun  Their fall  the rattling shot  his nerves perplexid  He thought perhaps it might be his turn next  It has been seen ere now  that  much elated  To be by some great man care  and fêted  A youth of humble birth  and mind industrious  Foregoes in evil hour his independance  And  charm to wait upon his friend illustrious  Gives up his time to flattery and attendance  His patron  smiling at his folly  lets him Some newer whim succeeds  and he forgets him  So fared our bird  his new friend  vacant stare  Told him he scarce remember he was there  And  when he talk of living more securely  This very dear friend  yawning  answered    Surely    You are quite right to do what  most expedient    So  au revoir  Good bye  Your most obedient    Allies in prosperous fortune thus he prov  And left them  unregretting  unbelov  Yet much his self love suffer by the shock  And now  his quiet cabin in the rock  The faithful partner of his every care  And all the ble ings he abandon there  Rush on his sickening heart  he felt it yearn  But pride and shame prevented his return  So wandering farther at the close of day To the high woods he pensive wing his way   But new distre  at every turn be found Struck by an hawk  and stunn upon the ground  He once by miracle escaped  then filed From a wild cat  and hid his trembling head Beneath a dock  recovering  on the wind He rose once more  and left his fears behind  And  as above the clouds he soar  the light Fell on an inland rock   the radiance bright Shew him his long deserted place of rest  And thitherward he flew  his throbbing breast Dwelt on his mate  so gentle  and so wrong  And on his memory throng The happine  he once at home had known   Then to forgive him earnest to engage her  And for his errors eager to atone  Onward he went  but ah  not yet had flown Fate  sharpest arrow   to decide a wager  Two sportsmen shot at our deserter   down The wind swift wheeling  struggling  still he fell  Close to the margin of the stream that flow Beneath the foot of his regretted cell  And the fresh gra  was spotted with his blood   To his dear home he turn his languid view  Deplor his folly  while he look his last  And sigh a long adieu   Thither to sip the brook  his nestlings  led By their still pensive mother  came  He saw  and murmuring forth her dear lov name  Implor her pity  and with shortening breath  Besought her to forgive him ere his death  And now  how hard in metre to relate The tears and tender pity of his mate   Or with what generous zeal  his faithful moitie Taught her now feather young  with duteous piety    To aid her  on their mutual wings to bear  With stork like care  Their suffering parent to the rock above  There  by the best physician  Love  his wounds were heal   His wanderings at an end  And sober quite  the husband  and the friend  In proof of reformation and contrition  Gave to his race this prudent adrnonition   Advice  which this  our fabling muse  presumes Níay benefit the biped without plumes     If of domestie peace you are po e     Learn to believe yourself supremely ble     And gratefully enjoying your condition    Frisk not about  on whims and fancies strange    For ten to one  you for the worse will change     And  tis most wise  to check all vain ambition By such aspiring pride the angels fell     So love your wife  and know when you are well
