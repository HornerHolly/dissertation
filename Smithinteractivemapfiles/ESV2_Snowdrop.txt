WAN Heralds of the sun and summer gale  
That seem just fallen from infant Zephyrs   wing   
Not now   as once   with heart revived I hail
Your modest buds   that for the brow of spring   
Form the first simple garland  Now no more
Escaping for a moment all my cares  
shall I   with pensive   silent   step explore
The woods yet leafless    where to chilling airs   
Your green and penciled blossoms   trembling   wave  
Ah   ye soft   transient   children of the ground  
More fair was she on whose untimely grave      
Flow my unceasing tears   Their varied round
The seasons go    while I through all repine   
For fixt regret   and hopeless grief are mine
