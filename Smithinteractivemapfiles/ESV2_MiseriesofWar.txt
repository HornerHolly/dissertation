a wild mountain   whose bare summit hides
Its broken eminence in clouds   whose steeps
Are dark with woods   where the receding rocks
Are worn with torrents of dissolving snow  
A wretched woman   pale and breathless   flies  
And   gazing round her   listens to the sound
Of hostile footsteps     No   they die away  
Nor noise remains   but of the cataract  
Or surly breeze of night   that mutters low
Among the thickets   where she trembling seeks
A temporary shelter  Clasping close
To her quick throbbing heart her sleeping child  

All she could rescue of the innocent group
That yesterday surrounded her  Escaped
Almost by miracle   Fear   frantic Fear  
Winged her weak feet   yet   half repenting now
Her headlong haste   she wishes she had staid
To die with those affrighted Fancy paints
The lawless soldiers   victims      Hark   again
The driving tempest bears the cry of Death   
And with deep   sudden thunder   the dread found   
Of cannon vibrates on the tremulous earth  
While   bursting in the air   the murderous bomb
Glares over her mansion  Where the splinters fall
Like scattered comets   its destructive path
Is marked by wreaths of flame  Then   overwhelm   

Beneath accumulated horror   finks
The desolate mourner   
The feudal Chief   whose Gothic battlements
Frown on the plain beneath   returning home
From distant lands   alone   and in disguise  
Gains at the fall of night his castle walls  
But   at the filent gate no porter fits
To wait his lord admittance     In the courts
All is drear stillness     Guessing but too well
The fatal truth   he shudders as he goes
Thro   the mute hall   where   by the blunted light

That the dim Moon thro   painted casement lends  
He sees that devastation has been there   
Then   while each hideous image to his mind
Rises terrific   over a bleeding corse   
stumbling he falls   another intercepts
His staggering feet  All   all who used to rush
With joy to meet him   all his family
Lie murdered in his way    And the day dawns
On a wild raving Maniac   whom a fate
so sudden and calamitous has robbed
Of reason    and who round his vacant walls
screams unregarded   and reproaches Heaven
