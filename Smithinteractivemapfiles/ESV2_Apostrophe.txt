WHERE thy broad branches brave the bitter North  
Like rugged   indigent   unheeded   worth  
Lo   Vegetation  s guardian hands emboss
Each giant limb with fronds of studded moss  
That clothes the bark in many   a fringed fold
Begemmed with scarlet shields   and cups of gold  
Which   to the wildest winds their webbs oppose  
And mock the arrowy sleet   or weltering snows  
  But to the warmer Weft the Woodbine fair

With tassels that perfumed the summer air  
The mantling Clematis   whose feathery bowers
Waved in feftoons with Nightshade purple flowers  
The silver weed   whose corded fillets wove
Round thy pale rind   even as deceitful love
Of mercenary beauty would engage
The dotard fondness of decrepit age   
All these   that during summer  s halcyon days
With their green canopies concealed thy sprays  
Are gone for ever   or disfigured   trail
Their fallow relicts in the Autumnal gale  
Or over thy roots   in faded fragments tost  
But tell of happier hours   and sweetness lost  
  Thus in Fate trying hour   when furious storms
strip social life of Pleasure fragile forms  


And aweful Justice   as his rightful prey
Tears Luxury silk   and jeweld robe   away  
While reads Adversity her lesson stern  
And Fortune minions tremble as they learn   
The crouds around her gilded car that hung  
Bent the lithe knee   and trould the honeyed tongue  
Desponding fall   or fly in pale despair   
And scorn alone remembers that they were  
Not so Integrity   unchanged he lives
In the rude armour conscious Honor gives  
And dares with hardy front the troubled sky  
In Honesty uninjured panoply  
Never on Prosperity enfeebling bed
Or rosy pillows   he reposed his head  

But given to useful arts   his ardent mind
Has sought the general welfare of mankind   
To mitigate their ills his greatest bliss  
While studying them   has taught him what he is   
He   when the human tempest rages worst  
And the earth shudders as the thunders burst  
Firm   as thy northern branch   is rooted fast  
And if he cant avert   endures the blast
