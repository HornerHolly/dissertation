On thy stupendous summit  rock sublime   That er the channel reared  half way at sea The mariner at early morning hails  I would recline   while Fancy should go forth  1 And represent the strange and awful hour Of vast concu ion  when the Omnipotent Stretch forth his arm  and rent the solid hills  Bidding the impetuous main food rush between The rifted shores  and from the continent Eternally divided this green isle  Imperial lord of the high southern coast   From thy projecting head land I would mark Far in the east the shades of night disperse  Melting and thinned  as from the dark blue wave Emerging  brilliant rays of arrowy light Dart from the horizon   when the glorious sun Just lifts above it his resplendent orb  Advances now  with feathery silver touched  The rippling tide of flood  glisten the sands  While  inmates of the chalky clefts that scar Thy sides precipitous  with shrill harsh cry  Their white wings glancing in the level beam  The terns  and gulls  and tarrocks  seek their food  And thy rough hollows echo to the voice Of the gray choughs  and ever restle  daws  With clamour  not unlike the chiding hounds  While the lone shepherd  and his bàying dog  Drive to thy turfy crest his bleating flock  The high meridian of the day is past  And Ocean now  reflecting the calın Ileaven  Is of cerulean hue  and murmurs low The tide of ebb  upon the level sands  The sloop  her angular canvas shifting still  Catches the light and variable airs That but a little crisp the summer sea  Dimpling its tranquil surface  Afar off  And just emerging from the arch immense Where seem to part the elements  a fleet Thes Of fishing ve els stretch their le er sails  Oili While more remote  and like a dubious spot And Just hanging in the horizon  laden deep  Van The ship of commerce richly freighted  makes The ller slower progre   on her distant voyage  Error Bound to the orient climates  where the sun Matures the spice within its odorous shell  Fresh Orso And  rivalling the gray worm filmy toil  Bursts from its pod the vegetable down  Which in long turban wreaths  from torrid heat And Defends the brows of Asia countle  casts  Are to There the Earth hides within her glowing breast From The beamy adamant  and the round pearl Enchased in rugged covering  which the slave  Divoc Glanci With perilous and breathle  toil  tears off From the rough sea rock  deep beneath the waves  These are the toys of Nature  and her sport Of little estimate in Reason eye  And they who reason  with abhorrence see Man  for such gaudes and baubles  violate The sacred freedom of his fellow man Erroneous estimate  As Heaven pure air  Fresh as it blows on this aërial height  Or sound of seas upon the stony strand  Or inland  the gay harmony of birds  And winds that wander in the leafy woods   Are to the unadulterate taste more worth 1 Than the elaborate harmony  brought out From fretted stop  or modulated airs Of vocal science  So the brightest gems  Glancing resplendent on the regal crown  Or trembling in the high born beauty ear  Are poor and paltry  to the lovely light Of the fair star  that as the day declines  Attendant on her queen  the crescent moon  Bathes her bright tre es in the eastern wave  For now the sun is verging to the sea  And as he westward sinks  the floating clouds Suspended  move upon the evening gale  And gathering round his orb  as if to

Nature through her works Shews only in the ethereal canopy  Thither aspiring Fancy fondly soars  Wandering sublime thro  visionary vales  Where bright pavilions rise  and trophies  fann By airs celestial   and adorn with wreaths Of flowers that bloom amid elysian bowers  Now bright  and brighter still the colours glow  Till half the lustrous orb within the flood Seems to retire   the flood reflecting still Its splendor  and in mimic glory drest  Till the last ray shot upward  fires the clouds With blazing crimson   then in paler light  Long lines of tenderer radiance  lingering yield To partial darkne   and on the opposing side The early moon distinctly rising  throws Her pearly brilliance on the trembling tide  The fishermen  who at set seasons pa  Many a league off at sea their

her a coaster from the north  Her keel Now ploughs the sand  and sidelong now she leans  While with loud clamours her athletic crew Unload her  and resounds the busy hum Along the wave worn rocks  Yet

 And sometimes cro ing on the moonbright line  Glimmers the skiff  faintly discern awhile  Then lost in shadow  Contemplation here  High on her throne of rock  aloof may sit  And bid recording Memory

 then received The new invaders   a proud martial race  Of Scandinavia the undaunted sons  Whom Dogon  Fier a bras  and Humfroi led To conquest   while  Trinacria to their power Yielded her wheaten

song daring Roland sang First in the fierce contention   vainly brave  One not inglorious struggle England made  But failing  saw the Saxon heptarchy Finish for ever    Then the holy pile  Yet seen

form from hence Presumptuous hopes  that ever thou again  Queen of the isles   shalt crouch to foreign arms  The enervate sons of Italy may yield  And the Iberian  all his trophies torn And wrapp in

meet a world in arms  England    twas where this promontory rears Its rugged brow above the channel wave  Parting the hostile nations  that thy fame  Thy naval fame was tarnish  at what time Thou  leagued with the Batavian  gavest to France One day of triumph triumph the more loud  Because even then so rare  Oh  well redeem  Since  by a series of illụstrious men  Such as no other country ever rear  To vindicate her cause  It is a list Which  as Fame echoes it  blanches the cheek Of bold Ambition   while the despot feels The extorted sceptre tremble in his grasp  From even the proudest roll by glory fill  How gladly the reflecting mind returns To simple scenes of peace and industry  Where  bosom in some valley of the hills Stands the lone farm  its gate with tawny ricks Surrounded  and with granaries and sheds  Roof with green mo es  and by elms and ash  Partially shaded  and not far remov The hut of sea flints built  the humble home Of one  who sometimes watches on the heights  When hid in the cold mist of pa ing clouds    The flock  with dripping fleeces  are dispers er the wide down  then from some ridged point That overlooks the sea  his eager eye Watches the bark that for his signal waits To land its merchandize   Quitting for this Clandestine traffic his more honest toil  The crook abandoning  he braves himself The heaviest snow storm of December night  When with conflicting winds the ocean raves  And on the to ing boat  unfearing mounts To meet the partners of the perilous trade  And share their hazard  Well it were for him  If no such commerce of destruction known  He were content with what the earth affords To human labour  even where she seems Reluctant most  More happy is the hind  Who  with his own hands rears on some black moor  Or turbary  his independent hut Cover with heather  whence the slow white smoke Of smouldering peat arises A few sheep  His best po e ion  with his children share The rugged shed when wintry tempests blow  But  when with Spring return the green blades rise Amid the ru et heath  the household live Joint tenants of the waste throughout the day  And often  from her nest  among the swamps  Where the gemm sur dew grows  or fring buck bean  They scare the plover  that with plaintive cries Flutters  as sorely wounded  down the wind  Rude  and but just remov from savage life Is the rough dweller among scenes like these   Scenes all unlike the poet fabling dreams Describing Arcady  But he is free  The dread that follows on illegal acts He never feels  and his industrious mate Shares in his labour  Where the brook is traced By crouding osiers  and the black coot hides Among the plashy reeds  her diving brood  The matron wades  gathering the long green rush That well prepar hereafter lends its light To her poor cottage  dark and cheerle  else Thro   the drear hours of Winter  Otherwhile She leads her infant group where charlock grows Unprofitably gay   or to the fields  Where congregate the linnet and the finch  That on the thistles  so profusely spread  Feast in the desert  the poor family Early resort  extirpating with care These  and the gaudier mischief of the ground  Then flames the high rais heap  seen afar off Like hostile war fires flashing to the sky  Another task is theirs  On fields that shew As angry Heaven had rain sterility  Stony and cold  and hostile to the plough  Where clamouring loud  the evening curlew runs And drops her spotted eggs among the flints  The mother and the children pile the stones In rugged pyramids   and all this toil They patiently encounter  well content On their flock bed to slumber undisturb Beneath the smoky roof they call their own  Oh  little knows the sturdy hind  who stands Gazing  with looks where envy and contempt Are often strangely mingled  on the car Where prosperous Fortune sits  what secret care Or sick satiety is often hid  Beneath the splendid outside   He knows not How frequently the child of Luxury Enjoying nothing  flies from place to place In chase of pleasure that eludes his grasp   And that content is e en le  found by him  Than by the labourer  whose pick axe smooths The road before his chariot  and who doffs What was an hat  and as the train pa  on  Thinks how one day expenditure  like this   Would cheer him for long months  when to his toil The fiozen earth closes her marble breast  Ah  who is happy  Happine   a word That like false fire  from marsh effluvia born  Misleads the wanderer  destin to contend In the world wilderne   with want or woe  Yet they are happy  who have never ask What good or evil means  The boy That on the river margin gaily plays  Has heard that Death is there He knows not Death  And therefore fears it not  and venturing in He gains a bullrush  or a minnow then  At certain peril  for a worthle  prize  A crow  or raven nest  he climbs the boll Of some tall pine  and of his prowe  proud  Is for a moment happy  Are your cares  Ye who despise him  never worse applied  The village girl is happy  who sets forth To distant fair  gay in her Sunday suit  With cherry colour knots  and flourish shawl  And bonnet newly purchas  So is he Her little brother  who his mimic drum Beats  till he drowns her rural lovers  oaths Of constant faith  and still increasing love  Ah  yet a while  and half those oaths believ  ller happine  is vanish  and the boy While yet a stripling  finds the sound he lov Has led him on  till he has given up Ilis freedom  and his happine  together  I once was happy  when while yet a child  I learn to love these upland solitudes  And  when elastic as the mountain air  To my light spirit  care was yet unknown And evil unforeseen   Early it came  And childhood scarcely pa ed  I was condemned  A guiltle  exile  silently to sigh  While Memory  with faithful pencil  drew The contrast  and regretting  I compar With the polluted smoky atmosphere And dark and stifling streets  the southern hills That to the setting Sun  their graceful heads Rearing  erlook the frith  where Vecta breaks With her white rocks  the strong impetuous tide  When western winds the vast Atlantic urge To thunder on the coast Haunts of my youth   Scenes of fond day dreams  I behold ye yet  Where  twas so pleasant by thy northern slopes To climb the winding sheep path  aided oft By scatter thorns  whose spiny branches bore Small woolly tufts  spoils of the vagrant lamb There seeking shelter from the noon day sun  And pleasant  seated on the short soft turt  To look beneath upon the hollow way While heavily upward mov the labouring wain  And stalking slowly by  the sturdy hind To ease his panting team  stopp with a stone The grating wheel  Advancing higher still The prospect widens  and the village church But little  er the lowly roofs around Rears its gray belfry  and its simple vane  But Those lowly roofs of thatch are half concealdi The Det By the rude arms of trees  lovely in spring  When on each bough  the rosy tinctur bloom Na Sits thick  and promises autumnal plenty  Dri For even those orchards round the Norman farms  Ang Which  as their owners mark the promis fruit  Gre Console them for the vineyards of the south  Th Surpa  not these  CE Where woods of ash  and beech  And partial copses  fringe the green hill foot  01 The upland shepherd rears his modest home  En There wanders by  a little namele  stream That from the hill wells forth  bright now and clear  Wi Or after rain with chalky mixture gray  lo But still refreshing in its shallow  course  The cottage garden  most for use design  Yet not of beauty destitute  The vine Mantles the little casement  yet the briar Drops fragrant dew among the July flowers  And pansies rayed  and freak and mottled pinks  Grow among balm  and rosemary and rue  There honeysuckles flaunt  and roses blow Almost uncultured  Some with dark green leaves Contrast their flowers of pure unsullied white  Others  like velvet robes of regal state  Of richest crimson  while in thorny mo  Enshrined and cradled  the most lovely  wear The hues of youthful beauty glowing check  With fond regret I recollect e en now In Spring and Summer  what delight I felt Among these cottage gardens  and how much Such artle  nosegays  knotted with a rush By village housewife or her ruddy maid  Were welcome to me  soon and simply pleas  An early worshipper at Nature shrine  I loved her rudest scenes warrens  and heaths  And yellow commons  and birch shaded hollows  And hedge rows  bordering unfrequented lanes Bowered with wild roses  and the clasping woodbine  Where purple ta els of the tangling vetch With bittersweet  and bryony inweave  And the dew fills the silver bindweed cups  I loved to trace the brooks whose humid banks Nourish the harebell  and the freckled pagil  And stroll among ershadowing woods of beech  Lending in Summer  from the heats of noon A whispering shade  while haply there reclines Some pensive lover of uncultur flowers  Who  from the tumps with bright green mo es clad  Plucks the wood sorrel  with its light thin leaves  Heart shaped  and triply folded  and its root Creeping like beaded coral   or who there Gathers  the copse pride  anémones  With rays like golden studs on ivory laid Most delicate   but touch with purple clouds  Fit crown for April fair but changeful brow  Ah  hills so early loved   in fancy still I breathe your pure keen air   and still behold Those widely spreading views  mocking alike The Poet and the Painter utmost art  And still  observing objects more minute  Wondering remark the strange and foreign forms Of sea shells  with the pale calcareous soil Mingled  and seeming of resembling substance   Tho  surely the blue Ocean  from the heights Where the downs westward trend  but dimly seen   Hlere never rolld its surge  Does Nature then  Mimic  in wanton mood  fantastic shapes Of bivalves  and inwreathed volutes  that cling To the dark sea rock of the wat ry world  Or did this range of chalky mountains  once Form a vast bason  where the Ocean waves Swell fathomle   What time these fo il shells  Buoy on their native element  were thrown Arnong the imbedding calx   when the huge hill Its giant bulk heaved  and in strange ferment Grew up a guardian barrier   twixt the sea And the green level of the sylvan weald  Ah  very vain is Science  proudest boast  And but a little light its flame yet lends To its most ardent votaries  since from whence These fo il forms are seen  is but conjecture  Food for vague theories  or vain dispute  While to his daily task the peasant gocs  Unheeding such inquiry  with no care But that the kindly change of sun and shower  Fit for his toil the earth he cultivates  As little recks the herdsman of the hill  Who on some turfy knoll  idly reclined  Watches his wether flock  that deep beneath Rest the remains of men  of whom is left No traces in the records of mankind  Save what these half obliterated mounds And half fill trenches doubtfully impart To some lone antiquary  who on times remote  Since which two thousand years have rolld away  Loves to contemplate  He perhaps may trace  Or fancy he can trace  the oblong square Where the mail legions  under Claudius  rear The rampire  or excavated fo é delved  What time the huge unwieldy Elephant Auxiliary reluctant  hither led  From Afric forest glooms and tawny sands  First felt the Northern blast  and his vast frame Sunk usele   whence in after ages found  The wondering hinds  on those enormous bones Gaz  and in giants dwelling on the hills Believed and marvellid Hither  Ambition  come  Come and behold the nothingne  of all For which you carry thro  the oppre ed Earth  War  and its train of horrors see where tread The innumerous hoofs of flocks above the works By which the warrior sought to register His glory  and immortalize his name The pirate Dane  who from his circular camp Bore in destructive robbery  fire and sword Down thro  the vale  sleeps unremember here  And here  beneath the green sward  rests alike The savage native  who his acorn meal Shar with the herds  that ranged the pathle  woods  And the centurion  who on these wide hills Encamping  planted the Imperial Eagle  All  with the lapse of Time  have pa ed away  Even as the clouds  with dark and dragon shapes  Or like vast promontories crown with towers  Cast their broad shadows on the downs  then sail Far to the northward  and their transient gloom Is soon forgotten  But from thoughts like these  By human crimes suggested  let us turn To where a more attractive study courts The wanderer of the hills  while shepherd girls Will from among the fescue bring him flowers  Of wonderous mockery  some resembling bees In velvet vest  intent on their sweet toil  While others mimic flies  that lightly sport In the green shade  or float along the pool  But here seem perch upon the slender stalk   And gathering honey dew  While in the breeze That wafts the thistle plumed seed along  Blue bells wave tremulous  The mountain thyme Purples the ha ock of the heaving mole  And the short turf is gay with torinentil  And bird foot trefoil  and the le er tribes Of hawkweed  spangling it with fringed stars  Near where a richer tract of cultur land Slopes to the south  and burnished by the sun  Bend in the gale of August  floods of corn   The guardian of the flock  with watchful care  Repels by voice and dog the encroaching sheep  While his boy visits every wired trap That scars the turf  and from the pit falls takes The tirnid migrants  who from distant wilds  Warrens  and stone quarries  are destined thus To lose their short existence  But unsought By Luxury yet  the Shepherd still protects The social bird  who from his native haunts Of willowy current  or the rushy pool  Follows the fleecy croud  and flirts and skims  In fellowship among them  Where the knoll More elevated takes the changeful winds  The windmill rears its vanes  and thitherward With his white load  the master travelling  Scares the rooks rising slow on whispering wings  While er his head  before the summer sun Lights up the blue expanse  heard more than seen  The lark sings matins  and above the clouds Floating  embathes his spotted breast in dew  Beneath the shadow of a gnarled thorn  Bent by the sea blast  from a seat of turf With fairy nosegays strewn  how wide the view  Till in the distant north it melts away  And mingles indiscriminate with clouds   But if the eye could reach so far  the mart Of England capital  its domes and spires Might be perceived Yet hence the distant range Of Kentish hills  appear in purple haze  And nearer  undulate the wooded heights  And airy summits  that above the mole Rise in green beauty  and the beacon ridge Of Black down shagg with heath  and swelling rude Like a dark island from the vale  its brow Catching the last rays of the evening sun That gleam between the nearer park old oaks  Then lighten up the river  and make prominent The portal  and the ruin battlements Of that dismantled fortre   rais what time The Conqueror succe ors fiercely fought  Tearing with civil feuds the desolate lạnd  But now a tiller of the soil dwells there  And of the turret loop and rafter halls Has made an humbler homestead Where he sees  Instead of armed foemen  herds that graze Along his yellow meadows  or his flocks At evening from the upland driv n to fold In such a castellated mansion unce A stranger chose his home  and where hard by In rude disorder fallen  and hid with brushwood Lay fragments gray of towers and buttre es  Among the ruins  often he would muse His rustic meal soon ended  he was wont To wander forth  listening the evening sounds Of rushing milldam  or the distant team  Or night jar  chasing fern flies  the tir hind Pa  him at nightfall  wondering he should sit On the hill top so late  they from the coast Who sought bye paths with their clandestine load  Şaw with suspicious doubt  the lonely man Cro  on their way  but village maidens thought His senses injur  and with pity say That he  poor youth  must have been cro  in love For often  stretch upon the mountain turf With folded arms  and eyes intently fix Where ancient elms and firs obscured a grange  Some little space within the vale below  They heard him  as complaining of his fate  And to the murmuring wind  of cold neglect And baffled hope he told  The peasant girls These plaintive sounds remember  and even now Among them may be heard the stranger songs  Were I a Shepherd on the hill And ever as the mists withdrew Could see the willows of the rill Shading the footway to the mill Where once I walk with you  And as away Night shadows sail  And sounds of birds and brooks arise  Believe  that from the woody vale I hear your voice upon the gale In soothing melodies   And viewing from the Alpine height  The prospect dre  in hues of air  Could say  while transient colours bright Touch the fair scene with dewy light   Tis  that her eyes are there  I think  I could endure my lot And linger on a few short years  And then  by all but you forgot  Sleep  where the turf that clothes the spot May claim some pitying tears  For  tis not easy to forget One  who thro  life has lov you still  And you  however late  might yet With sighs to Memory giv n  regret The Shepherd of the Hill  Yet otherwhile it seem as if young Hope Her flattering pencil gave to Fancy hand  And in his wanderings  rear to sooth his soul Ideal bowers of pleasure Then  of Solitude And of his hermit life  still more cnamour  Ilis home was in the forest  and wild fruits And bread sustain him  There in early spring The Barkmen found him  e er the sun arose   There at their daily toil  the Wedgecutters Beheld him thro  the distant thicket move  The shaggy dog following the truffle hunter  Bark at the loiterer   and perchance at night Belated villagers from fair or wake  While the fresh night wind let the moonbeams in Between the swaying boughs  just saw him pa   And then in silence  gliding like a ghost He vanish  Lost among the deepening gloom   But near one ancient tree  whose wreathed roots Form a rude couch  love songs and scatter rhymes  Unfinish sentences  or half erased  And rhapsodies like this  were sometimes found Let us to woodland wilds repair While yet the glittering night dews seem To wait the freshly breathing air  Precursive of the morning beam  That rising with advancing day  Scatters the silver drops away  An elm  uprooted by the storm  The trunk with mo es gray and green  Shall make for us a rustic form    Where lighter grows the forest scene  And far among the bowery shades  Are ferny lawns and gra y glades    Retiring May to lovely June Her latest garland now resigns   The banks with cuckoo flowers are strewn  The woodwalks blue with columbines  And with its reeds  the wandering stream Reflects the flag flower golden gleam  There  feathering down the turf to meet  Their shadowy arms the beeches spread  While high above our sylvan seat  Lifts the light ash its airy head  And later leaved  the oaks between Extend their bows of vernal green  The slender birch its paper rind Seems offering to divided love  And shuddering even without a wind Aspins  their paler foliage move  As if some spirit of the air Breath a low sigh in pa ing there  The Squirrel in his frolic mood  Will fearle  bound among the boughs  Yaffils laugh loudly thro  the wood  And murmuring ring doves tell their vows  While we  as sweetest woodscents rise  Listen to woodland melodies   And I ll contrive a sylvan room Against the time of summer heat  Where leaves  inwoven in Nature loom  Shall canopy our green retreat   And gales that   close the eye of day  Shall linger  e er they die away  And when a sear and sallow hue From early frost the bower receives  I ll dre  the sand rock cave for you  And strew the floor with heath and leaves  That you  against the autumnal air May find securer shelter there  The Nightingale will then have ceas To sing her moonlight serenade   But the gay bird with blushing breast  And Woodlarks still will haunt the shade  And by the borders of the spring Reed wrens will yet be carolling  The forest hermits lonely cave None but such soothing sounds shall reach  Or hardly heard  the distant wave Slow breaking on the stony beach  Or winds  that now sigh soft and low  Now make wild music as they blow  And then  before the chilling North The tawny foliage falling light  Seems  as it flits along the earth  The footfall of the busy Sprite  Who wrapt in pale autumnal gloom  Calls ир  the mist born Mushroom  Oh  could I hear your soft voice there  And see you in the forest green All beauteous as you are  more fair You ld look  amid the sylvan scene  And in a wood girl simple guise  Be still more lovely in mine eyes  Ye phantoms of unreal delight  Visions of fond delirium born  Rise not on my deluded sight  Then leave me drooping and forlorn To know  such bli  can never be  Unle  loved like me  The visionary  nursing dreams like these  Is not indeed unhappy  Summer woods Wave over him  and whisper as they wave  Some future ble ings he may yet enjoy  And as above him sail the silver clouds  He follows them in thought to distant climes  Where  far from the cold policy of this    Dividing him from her he  fondly loves  He  in some island of the southern sea  May haply build his cane constructed bower Beneath the bread fruit  or aspiring palm  With long green foliage rippling in the gale  Oh  let him cherish his ideal bli  For what is life  when Hope has ceas to strew Her fragile flowers along its thorny way  And sad and gloomy are his days  who lives Of Hope abandon  Just beneath the rock Where Beachy overpeers the channel wave  Within a cavern mined by wintry tides Dwelt one  who long disgusted with the world And all its ways  appear to suffer life  Rather than live  the soul reviving gale  Fanning the bean field  or the thymy heath  Had not for many suminers breathed on him  And nothing mark to him the season change  Save that more gently rose the placid sea  And that the birds which winter on the coast Gave place to other migrants  save that the fog  Hovering no more above the beetling cliffs Betray not then the little carele  sheep On the brink grazing  while their headlong fall Near the lone Hermit flint surrounded home  Claim unavailing pity   for his heart Was feelingly alive to all that breathed  And outraged as he was  in sanguine youth  By human crimes  he still acutely felt For human misery  Wandering on the beach  He learn to augur from the clouds of heaven  And from the changing colours of the sea  And sullen murmurs of the hollow cliffs  Or the dark porpoises  that near the shore Gambold and sported on the level brine When tempests were approaching  then at night He listen to the wind  and as it drovę The billows with erwhelming vehemence He  starting from his rugged couch  went forth And hazarding a life  too valuele   Ile waded thro  the waves  with plank or pole Towards where the mariner in conflict dread Was buffeting for life the roaring surge   And now just seen  now lost in foaming gulphs  The disnal gleaming of the clouded moon Shew the dire peril  Often he had snatch From the wild billows  some unhappy man Who liv to ble  the hermit of the rocks  But if his generous cares were all in vain  And with slow swell the tide of morning bore Some blue swol n cor se  to land  the pale recluse Dug in the chalk a sepulchre above Where the dank sea wrack rk the utmost tide  And with his prayers perform the obsequies For the poor helple  stranger  One dark night The equinoctial wind blew south by west  Fierce on the shore   the bellowing cliffs were shook Even to their stony base  and fragments fell Flashing and thundering on the angry flood  At day break  anxious for the lonely man  His cave the mountain shepherds visited  Tho sand and banks of weeds had choak their way He was not in it  but his drowned cor se By the waves wafted  near his former home Receiv the rites of burial  Those who read Chisel within the rock  these mournful lines  Memorials of his sufferings  did not grieve  That dying in the cause of charity His spirit  from its earthly bondage freed  Had to some better region fled for ever
