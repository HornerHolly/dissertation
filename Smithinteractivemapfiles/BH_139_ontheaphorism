  FriendsilP  as some sage poet sings  Is chasten Love  depriv of wings  Without all wish or power to wander   Le  volatile  but not le  tender   Yet says the proverb   Sly and slow   Love creeps  even where he cannot go    To clip his pinions then is vain  His old propensities remain   And she  who years beyond fifteen    Has counted twenty  may have seen How rarely unplum Love will stay  He flies not but he coolly walks away
