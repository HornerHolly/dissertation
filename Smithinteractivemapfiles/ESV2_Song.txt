 Ah   say     the fair Louisa cried  
say where the abode of Love is found     
Pervading Nature   I replied  
His influence spreads the world around  
When Morning  s arrowy beams arise  
He sparkles in the enlivening ray  
And blushes in the glowing skies
When rosy Evening fades away  
The summer winds that gently blow  
The flocks that bleat along the glades  
The nightingale   that soft and low  
With music fills the listening shades   

The murmurs of the silver surf
All echo Love enchanting notes  
From Violets lurking in the turf  
His balmy breath thro   Ã¦ther floats  

From perfumed flowers and dewy leaves
Delicious scents he bids exhale  
He smiles amid Autumnal sheaves  
And clothes with green the grassy vale  
But when that throne the God assumes
Where his most powerful influence lies  
  Tis on Louisas cheek he blooms  
And lightens from her radiant eyes
