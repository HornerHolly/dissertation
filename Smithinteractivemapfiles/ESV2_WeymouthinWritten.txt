THE chill waves whiten in the sharp North  east   
Cold   cold the night  blast comes   with fullen sound  
And black and gloomy   like my cheerless breast   
Frowns the dark pier and lonely sea  view round  
Yet a few months  and on the peopled strand
Pleasure shall all her varied forms display   
Nymphs lightly tread the bright reflecting sand  
And proud fails whiten all the summer bay  
Then   for these winds that whistle keen and bleak  
Music delightful melodies shall float
over the blue waters   but   tis mine to seek
Rather   some unfrequented shade   remote
From sights and sounds of gaiety   I mourn
All that gave me delight   Ah   never to return
