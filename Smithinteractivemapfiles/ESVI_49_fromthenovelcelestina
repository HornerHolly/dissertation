 O THOU   who sleep st where hazle bands entwine The vernal gra   with paler violets drest     I would  sweet maid   thy humble bed were mine  And mine thy calm and enviable rest  For never more by human ills opprest Shall thy soft spirit fruitle ly repine  Thou canst not now thy fondest hopes resign Even in the hour that should have made thee blest  Light lies the turf upon thy virgin breast  And lingering here  to love and sorrow true  The youth who once thy simple heart po est Shall mingle tears with April early dew  While still for him shall faithful Memory save Thy form and virtues from the filent grave
