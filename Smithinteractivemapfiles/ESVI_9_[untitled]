 Blest is yon shepherd  on the turf reclined  Who on the varied clouds which float above Lies idly gazing while his vacant mind Pours out some tale antique of rural love  Ah  he has never felt the pangs that move Th  indignant spirit  when with selfish pride  Friends  on whose faith the trusting heart rely  Unkindly shun th  imploring eye of woe  The ills they ought to sooth  with taunts deride  And laugh at tears themselves have forced to flow  Nor his rude bosom those fine feelings melt  Children of Sentiment and Knowledge born  Thro  whom each shaft with cruel force is felt  Empoison by deceitor barb with scorn
