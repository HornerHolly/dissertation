As in the woods   where leathery Lichen weaves
Its wintry web among the sallow leaves  
Which   thro   cold months in whirling eddies blown  
Decay beneath the branches once their own  
From the brown shelter of their foliage sear  
spring the young blooms that lead the floral year   
When   waked by vernal suns   the Pilewort dares
Fxpand her spotted leaves   and shining stars
  
And   veins empurpling all her tassels pale  
Bends the soft Wind  flower in the tepid gale   
Uncultured bells of azure Jacynth   blow  
And the breeze  fcenting Violet lurks below   

so views the wanderer   with delighted eyes  
Reviving hopes from black despondence rise  
When   blighted by Adversity  s chill breath  
Those hopes had felt a temporary death       
Then with gay heart he looks to future hours       
When Love shall dress for him the summer bowers     
And   as delicious dreams enchant his mind  
Forgets his sorrows past   or gives them to the wind
