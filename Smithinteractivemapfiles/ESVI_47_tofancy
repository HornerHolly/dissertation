 tHEE  Queen of Shadows   shall I still invoke  Still love the scenes thy sportive pencil drew  When on mine eyes the early radiance broke Which shew the beauteous rather than the true   Alas  long since those glowing tints are dead  And now  tis thine in darkest hues to dre  The spot where pale Experience hangs her head over the fad grave of murder Happine   Thro  thy false medium  then  no longer view  May fancied pain and fancied pleasure fly  And I  as from me all thy dreams depart  Be to my wayward destiny subdued   Nor seek perfection with a poet eye  Nor suffer anguish with a poet heart
