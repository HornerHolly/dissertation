  On  soothing hour  when glowing day  Low in the western wave declines  And village murmurs die away  And bright the vesper planet shines   I love to hear the gale of Even Breathing along the new leaf ºd copse  And feel the freshening dew of Heaven  Fall silently in limpid drops  For  like a friend  consoling sighs  That breeze of night to me appears   And  as soft dew from Pity  eyes  Descend those pure celestial tears  Alas  for those who long have borne  Like me  a heart by sorrow riven  Who  but the plaintive winds  will mourn  What tears will fall  but those of Heaven
