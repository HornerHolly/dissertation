 BE the proud Thames of trade the busy mart   Arun  to thee will other praise belong   Dear to the lover  and the mourner heart  And ever sacred to the fons of song  Thy banks romantic hopele  Love shall seek  Where over the rocks the mantling bindwith flaunts  And Sorrow drooping form and faded cheek Choose on thy willow shore her lonely haunts   Banks  which inspired thy Otway plaintive strain   Wilds   whose lorn echoes learn the deeper tone Of Collins  powerful shell   yet once again Another poet Hayley is thine own  Thy cla ic stream anew shall hear a lay  Bright as its waves  and various as its way
