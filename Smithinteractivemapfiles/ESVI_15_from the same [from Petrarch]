WHERE the green leaves exclude the summer beam  And softly bend as balmy breezes blow  And where  with liquid lapse  the lucid stream Acro  the fretted rock is heard to flow  Pensive I lay  when she whom Earth conceals  As if still living  to my eyes appears  And pitying Heaven her angel form reveals  To say  Unhappy Petrarch  dry your tears     Ah  why  sad lover  thus before your time    In grief and sadne  should your life decay    And like a blighted flower  your manly prime   In vain and hopele  forrow fade away  Ah  yield not thus to culpable despair    But raise thine eyes to Heaven and think I wait thee there
