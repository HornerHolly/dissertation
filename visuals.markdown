# Chapter 1: Wordsworth and Sound

The generated sound spectrum sample, featured below, is an alphabetized list of sound words from Wordsworth’s poetic canon. It illustrates where I suspect certain sound-words to fall on the harmonic-discordant sound spectrum on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing the most harmonic, 10 being the most discordant, and 5.5 indicating silence or neutral sounds. I created the sound spectrum to help visualize that the harmonic to discordant scale is not a binary, but rather a complicated spectrum. The sharp peaks and valleys, almost like a heart out of rhythm, shows that Wordsworth’s sound language varies widely. As seen in Figure 1, “song” is a harmonic inflected word that ranks 1 out of 10 and “yell” is ranked 10 out of 10 on the discordance. Although not all 253 unique sound words are featured in Figure 1, the fully interactive sound spectrum on my website allows users to isolate particular words

# Chapter 2: Byron and Sites of Sound
The goal for this chapter is to consider the sound studies discourse in relation to The Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage and observe any potential patterns through distant reading methods. I used the data from the word frequency calculations to build a spreadsheet identifying sound words and the geographic locations they occurred within. I started by manually combing through all of the word frequencies and documenting which sound words were used and how often. From there, I searched through my plaintext file of all Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage for each one of the words to record their poetic line and where the sound word took place.  I then generated a map to illustrate where the sites of sound were located.

# Chapter 3: Charlotte Smith and Space


 This map was created for my third dissertation chapter on Charlotte Smith's poetry and place. I posit that the relationship between Smith’s apprehensions about contemporary social and political tensions that is evident in Beachy Head can be 1) applied to all her poetic works in (name editions) and 2) made visible through digital mapping methods.  The mapping process makes it possible to see how Smith uses geography to create distance between herself and the current political and social climate.  By using RStudio to generate a mapping visualization that plots possible geographic coordinates, I aim to illustrate how Smith’s poetic imagination engages in global and local locations in relationship to her thoughts on Great Britain’s imperial enterprises.  Due the geographic nature of Smith’s poetic canon, it’s necessary and illuminating to create a visualization of her works’ movements across England, Europe, and the globe in order to understand how her works engage with globalized Romanticism.  

This interactive map was made in RStudio with ggplot2, and Shiny. For technical details on how its created, please see my blog post. It is intended to illustrate how Charlotte Smith uses real, plottable locations in her poetry and her preoccupation with British imperialism.
