 tHE poet fancy takes from Flora realm Her buds and leaves to dre  fiÄ‰titious powers  With the green olive shades Minerva helm  And gives to Beauty Queen the Queen of flowers  But what gay blo oms of luxuriant Spring  With rose  mimosa  amaranth entwined  Shall fabled Sylphs and fairy people bring  As a just emblem of the lovely mind   In vain the mimic pencil tries to blend The glowing dyes that dre  the flowery race  Scented and colour by an hand divine   Ah  not le  vainly would the Muse pretend On her weak lyre  to sing the native grace And native goodne  of a foul like thine
