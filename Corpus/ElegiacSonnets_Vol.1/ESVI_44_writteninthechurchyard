 pRE  by the Moon  mute arbitre  of tides  While the loud equinox its power combines  The sea no more its swelling surge confines  But o er the shrinking land fublimely rides  The wild blast  rising from the Western cave  Drives the huge billows from their heaving bed   Tears from their grasfy tombs the village dead  And breaks the filent fabbath of the grave   With shells and sea weed mingled  on the shore Lo  their bones whiten in the frequent wave   But vain to them the winds and waters rave  They hear the warring elements no more   While I am doomed by life long storm opprest  To gaze with envy on their gloomy rest
