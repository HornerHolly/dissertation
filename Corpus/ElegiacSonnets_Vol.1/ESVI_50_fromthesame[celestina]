 fAREWEL  ye lawns   by fond remembrance blest  As witne es of gay unclouded hours   Where  to maternal friendship bosom prest  My happy childhood past amid your bowers  Ye wood walks wild   where leaves and fairy flowers By Spring luxuriant hand are strewn anew   Rocks   whence with shadowy grace rude nature lours over glens and haunted streams     a long adieu   And you   O promised Happine     whose voice Deluded Fancy heard in every grove  Bidding this tender  trusting heart  rejoice In the bright prospect of unfailing love   Tho  loft to me still may thy smile serene Ble  the dear lord of this regretted scene
