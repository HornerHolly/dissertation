 Go  rural Naiad  wind thy stream along Thro  woods and wilds  then seek the ocean caves Where sea nymphs meet their coral rocks among  To boast the various honors of their waves    Tis but a little  over thy shallow tide  That toiling trade her burden ve el leads  But laurels grow luxuriant on thy side  And letters live along thy cla ic meads  Lo  where  mid British bards thy natives shine   And now another poet helps to raise Thy glory high the poet of the Mine  Whose brilliant talents are his smallest praise   And who  to all that genius can impart  Adds the cool head  and the unblemish heart
