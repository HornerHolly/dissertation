 IN thy wild banks  by frequent torrents worn  No glittering fanes  or marble domes appear  Yet shall the mournful Muse thy course adorn  And still to her thy rustic waves be dear  For with the infant Otway  lingering here  Of early woes she bade her votary dream  While thy low murmurs sooth his pensive ear  And still the poet consecrates the stream  Beneath the oak and birch that fringe thy side  The first born violets of the year shall spring  And in thy hazles  bending over the tide  The earliest Nightingale delight to sing   While kindred spirits  pitying  shall relate Thy Otway sorrows  and lament his fate
