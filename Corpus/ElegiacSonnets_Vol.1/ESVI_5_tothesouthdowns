 AH   hills beloved  where once  an happy child  Your beechen shades  your turf  your flowers among   I wove your blue bells into garlands wild  And woke your echoes with my artle  song  Ah  hills beloved your turf  your flowers remain   But can they peace to this sad breast restore  For one poor moment footh the sense of pain  And teach a breaking heart to throb no more  And you  Aruna   in the vale below  As to the sea your limpid waves you bear  Can you one kind Lethean cup bestow  To drink a long oblivion to my care   Ah  no  when all  e en Hope last ray is gone  There no oblivion but in death alone
