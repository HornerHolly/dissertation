 POOR melancholy bird  that all night long Tell st to the Moon thy tale of tender woe   From what fad cause can such sweet sorrow flow  And whence this mournful melody of song   Thy poet musing fancy would translate What mean the sounds that swell thy little breast  When still at dewy eve thou leavest thy nest  Thus to the listening night to sing thy fate   Pale Sorrow victims wert thou once among  Tho  now released in woodlands wild to rove   Say hast thou felt from friends some cruel wrong  Or died st thoum artyr of disastrous love   Ah  songstre  sad  that such my lot might be  To sigh and sing at liberty  like thee
