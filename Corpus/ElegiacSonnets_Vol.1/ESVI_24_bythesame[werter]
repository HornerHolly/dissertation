 MAKE there my tomb  beneath the lime tree shade  Where gra  and flowers in wild luxuriance wave   Let no memorial mark where I am laid  Or point to common eyes the lover grave  But oft at twilight morn  or closing day  The faithful friend with fault ring step shall glide  Tributes of fond regret by stealth to pay  And sigh over the unhappy suicide  And sometimes  when the Sun with parting rays Gilds the long gra  that hides my silent bed  The tear shall tremble in my CHARLOTTE eyes   Dear  precious drops    they shall embalm the dead   Yes CHARLOTTE over the mournful spot shall weep  Where her poor WERTER  and his forrows sleep
