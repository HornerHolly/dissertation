ON thy grey bark  in witne  of my flame  I carve Miranda cypher  Beauteous tree   Graced with the lovely letters of her name  Henceforth be sacred to my love and me  Tho  the tall elm  the oak  and darker pine  With broader arms  may noon fierce ardors break  To shelter me  and her I love  be thine   And thine to see her smile and hear her speak  No bird  ill omen  round thy graceful head Shall clamour harsh  or wave his heavy wing  But fern and flowers arise beneath thy shade  Where the wild bees their lullabies shall fing  And in thy boughs the murmuring Ring dove rest  And there the Nightingale shall build her nest
