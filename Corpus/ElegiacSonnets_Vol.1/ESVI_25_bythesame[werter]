 WHY should I wish to hold in this low sphere   A frail and feverish being    wherefore try Poorly from day to day to linger here  Against the powerful hand of Destiny  By those who know the force of hopele  care On the worn heart I sure shall be forgiven  If to elude dark guilt  and dire despair  I go uncallid to mercy and to Heaven  O thou  to save whose peace I now depart  Will thy soft mind thy poor lost friend deplore  When worms shall feed on this devoted heart  Where even thy image shall be found no more   Yet may thy pity mingle not with pain  For then thy haple  lover  dies in vain
