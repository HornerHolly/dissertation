 the partial Muse  has from my earliest hours   Smiled on the rugged path I m doomed to tread  And still with sportive hand has snatch wild flowers  To weave fantastic garlands for my head   But far  far happier is the lot of those Who never learn her dear delusive art  Which  while it decks the head with many a rose  Reserves the thorn  to fester in the heart  For still she bids soft Pity melting eye Stream over the hills she knows not to remove  Points every pang  and deepens every sigh Of mourning friendship  or unhappy love  Ah  then  how dear the Muse favours cost  If those paint forrow beft who feel it most
