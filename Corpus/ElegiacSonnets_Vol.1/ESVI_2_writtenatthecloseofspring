 The garlands fade that Spring fo lately wove  Each simple flower  which she had nursed in dew  Anemonies  that spangled every grove  The primrose wan  and hare bell  mildly blue  No more shall violets linger in the dell  Or purple orchis variegate the plain  Till Spring again shall call forth every bell  And dre  with humid hands her wreaths again  Ah  poor humanity  so frail  so fair  Are the fond visions of thy early day  Till tyrant pa ion  and corrosive care  Bid all thy fairy colours fade away  Another May new buds and flowers shall bring   Ah  why has happine no second Spring
