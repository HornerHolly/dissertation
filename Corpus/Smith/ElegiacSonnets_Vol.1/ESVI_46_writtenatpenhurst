 YE towers sublime   deserted now and drear  Ye woods   deep fighing to the hollow blast  The musing wanderer loves to linger near  While History points to all your glories paft  And startling from their haunts the timid deer  To trace the walks obscured by matted fern  Which Waller soothing lyre were wont to hear  But where now clamours the discordant hern  The spoiling hand of Time may overturn These lofty battlements  and quite deface The fading canvas whence we love to learn Sydney keen look  and Sachari a grace   But fame and beauty still defy decay  Saved by the historic page the poet tender lay
