 GO   cruel tyrant of the human breast   To other hearts thy burning arrows bear   Go  where fond hope  and fair illusion rest  Ah  why should love inhabit with despair   Like the poor maniac I linger here  Still haunt the scene where all my treasure lies   Still seek for flowers where only thorns appear  And drink delicious poison from her eyes   Tow rds the deep gulf that opens on my sight I hurry forward  Pa ion helple  flave   And scorning Reason mild and sober light  Pursue the path that leads me to the grave   So round the flame the giddy insect flies  And courts the fatal fire by which it dies
