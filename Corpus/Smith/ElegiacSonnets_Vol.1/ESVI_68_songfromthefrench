 FRUIT of Aurora tears  fair rose  On whose soft leaves fond Zephyrs play  Oh  queen of flowers  thy buds disclose  And give thy fragrance to the day   Unveil thy transient charms  ah  no  A little be thy bloom delay  Since the same hour that bids thee blow  Shall see thee droop thy languid head  II  But go  and on Themira breast Find  happy flower  thy throne and tomb   While  jealous of a fate so blest  How shall I envy thee thy doom   Should some rude hand approach thee there  Guard the sweet shrine thou wilt adorn   Ah  punish those who rashly dare  And for my rivals keep thy thorn  III  Love shall himself thy boughs compose  And bid thy wanton leaves divide   He ll shew thee how  my lovely rose  To deck her bosom  not to hide   And thou shalt tell the cruel maid How frail are youth and beauty charms  And teach her  ere her own shall fade  To give them to her lover arms
