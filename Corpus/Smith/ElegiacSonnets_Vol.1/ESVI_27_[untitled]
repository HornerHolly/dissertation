 SIGHING I see yon little troop at play  By sorrow yet untouch   unhurt by care   While free and sportive they enjoy to day    Content and carele  of to morrow fare   O happy age  when Hope unclouded ray Lights their green path  and prompts their simple mirth  Ere yet they feel the thorns that lurking lay To wound the wretched pilgrims of the earth  Making them rue the hour that gave them birth  And threw them on a world so full of pain  Where prosperous folly treads on patient worth  And  to deaf pride  misfortune pleads in vain   Ah  for their future fate how many fears Oppre  my heart and fill mine eyes with tears
