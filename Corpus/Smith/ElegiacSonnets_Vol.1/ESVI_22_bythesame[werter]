 OH  Solitude  to thy sequester vale I come to hide my forrow and my tears  And to thy echoes tell the mournful tale Which scarce I trust to pitying Friendship ears  Amidst thy wild woods  and untrodden glades  No sounds but those of melancholy move  And the low winds that die among thy shades  Seem like soft Pity sighs for hopele  love   And sure some story of despair and pain  In yon deep copse  thy murm ring doves relate   And  hark  methinks in that long plaintive strain  Thine own sweet songstre  weeps my wayward fate  Ah  Nymph  that fate affist me to endure  And bear awhile  what death alone can cure
