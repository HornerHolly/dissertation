 THE shivering native  who by Tenglio side Beholds with fond regret the parting light Sink far away  beneath the darkening tide  And leave him to long months of dreary night  Yet knows  that springing from the eastern wave The Sun glad beams shall re illume his way  And from the snows secured within his cave He waits in patient hope returning day  Not so the sufferer feels  who  o er the waste Of joyle  life  is destin to deplore Fond love forgotten  tender friendship past  Which  once extinguish  can revive no more  over the blank void he looks with hopele  pain   For him those beams of heaven shall never shine again
