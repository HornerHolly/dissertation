 In this tumultuous sphere  for thee unfit  How seldom art thou found Tranquillity  Unle   tis when with mild and downcast eye By the low cradles thou delight st to fit Of sleeping infants  watching the soft breath  And bidding the sweet slumberers easy lie  Or sometimes hanging o er the bed of death  Where the poor languid sufferer hopes to die  Oh  beauteous sister of the halcyon peace  I sure shall find thee in that heavenly scene Where care and anguish shall their power resign  Where hope alike  and vain regret shall cease  And Memory loft in happine  serene  Repeat no more  that misery has been mine
