YE vales and woods  fair scenes of happier hours   Ye feather people  tenants of the grove   And you  bright stream  befringed with shrubs and flowers  Behold my grief  ye witne es of love  For ye beheld my infant pa ion rise  And saw thro  years unchanged my faithful flame   Now cold  in dust  the beauteous object lies  And you  ye conscious scenes  are still the same   While busy Memory still delights to dwell On all the charms these bitter tears deplore  And with a trembling hand describes too well The angel form I shall behold no more  To Heaven she  fled  and nought to me remains But the pale ashes which her urn contains
