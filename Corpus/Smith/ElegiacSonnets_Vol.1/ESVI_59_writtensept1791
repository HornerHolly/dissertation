  WHAT awful pageants crowd the evening sky  The low horizon gathering vapours shroud  Sudden  from many a deep embattled cloud Terrific thunders burst and lightnings fly  While in serenest azure  beaming high  Night regent  of her calm pavilion proud  Gilds the dark shadows that beneath her lie      Unvex by all their confli√©ts fierce and loud     So  in unsullied dignity elate  A spirit conscious of superior worth  In placid elevation firmly great  Scorns the vain cares that give Contention birth  And blest with peace  above the shocks of Fate  Smiles at the tumult of the troubled earth
