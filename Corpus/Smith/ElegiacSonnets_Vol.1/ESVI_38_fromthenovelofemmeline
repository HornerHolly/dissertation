 WHEN welcome slumber sets my spirit free  Forth to fi titious happine  it flies  And where Elysian bowers of bli  arise  I seem  my Emmeline to meet with thee  Ah  Fancy then  di olving human ties  Gives me the wishes of my soul to see  Tears of fond pity fill thy soften eyes   In heavenly harmony our hearts agree  Alas  these joys are mine in dreams alone  When cruel Reason abdicates her throne   Her harsh return condemns me to complain Thro  life unpitied  unrelieved  unknown  And as the dear delusions leave my brain  She bids the truth recur  with aggravated pain
