 WHEN Jove  in anger to the sons of earth  Bid artful Vulcan give Pandora birth  And sent the fatal gift which spread below O er all the wretched race contagious woe  Unhappy man  by vice and folly tost  Found in the storms of life his quiet lost  While Envy  Avarice  and Ambition  hurld Discord and death around the warring world   Then the blest peasant left his fields and fold  And barter love and peace for power and gold   Left his calm cottage and his native plain  In search of wealth to tempt the faithle  main   Or  braving danger  in the battle stood  And bathed his favage hands in human blood   No longer then  his woodland walks among  The shepherd lad his genuine pa ion fung  Or sought at early morn his soul delight  Or graved her name upon the bark at night   To deck her flowing hair no more he wove The simple wreath  or with ambitious love Bound his own brow with myrtle or with bay  But broke his pipe  or threw his crook away  The nymphs forsaken  other pleasures fought   Then first for gold their venal hearts were bought  And nature blush to fickly art gave place  And affectation seized the seat of grace   No more simplicity by sense refined  Or generous sentiment  po e  the mind   No more they felt each other joy and woe  And Cupid fled  and hid his usele  bow  But with deep grief propitious Venus pined  To see the ills which threaten womankind  Ills that she knew her empire would disarm  And rob her subjects of their sweetest charm   Good humour potent influence destroy  And change for lowering frowns the smile of joy  Then deeply sighing at the mournful view  She try at length what heavenly art could do To bring back Pleasure to her pensive train  And vindicate the glories of her reign  A thousand little loves attend the task  And bear from Mars head his radiant casque  The fair enchantre  on its silver bound Weaved with soft spells her magic cestus round  Then shaking from her hair ambrosial dew  Infused fair hope  and expectation new  And stifled wishes  and persuasive sighs  And fond belief  and eloquence of eyes   And falt ring accents  which explain so well What studied speeches vainly try to tell   And more pathetic filence  which imparts Infectious tenderne  to feeling hearts   Soft tones of pity  fascinating smiles   And Maia son a isted her with wiles  And brought gay dreams  fantastic visions brought  And waved his wand o er the seducing draught  Then Zephyr came   to him the godde  cry    Go fetch from Flora all her flowery pride   To fill my charm  each scented bud that blows    And bind my myrtles with her thornle  rose     Then speed thy flight to Gallia smiling plain  Where rolls the Loire  the Garonne  and the Seine   © Dip in their waters thy celestial wing  And the soft dew to fill my chalice bring   6 But chiefly tell thy Flora  that to me She send a bouquet of her fleurs de lys     That poignant spirit will complete my spell    Tis done   the lovely sorcere  says  tis well  And now Apollo lends a ray of fire  The cauldron bubbles  and the flames aspire   The watchful Graces round the circle dance  With arms entwined to mark the work advance   And with full quiver sportive Cupid came  Temp ring his favourite arrows in the flame  Then Venus speaks  the wavering flames retire  And Zephyr breath extinguishes the fire  At length the godde  in the helmet round A sweet and fubtil fpirit duly found  More soft than oil  than æther more refined  Of power to cure the woes of womankind  And call it Flattery    balm of female life  It charms alike the widow  maid  and wife  Clears the sad brow of virgins in despair  And smooths the cruel traces left by care   Bids palsied age with youthful spirit glow  And hangs May garlands on December snow    Delicious e ence   howsoe er apply  By what rude nature is thy charm deny   Some form seducing still thy whisper wears  Stern Wisdom turns to thee her willing ears  And Prudery listens and forgets her fears  The rustic nymph whom rigid aunts restrain  Condemn to dre   and practise airs in vain  At thy first summons finds her bosom swell  And bids her crabbed gouvernantes farewel   While  fired by thee with spirit not her own  She grows a toast  and rises into ton  The faded beauty who with secret pain Sees younger charms usurp her envied reign  By thee a isted  can with smiles behold The record where her conquests are enrollid  And dwelling yet on scenes by memory nursed  When George the Second reign  or George the First  She sees the shades of ancient beaux arise  Who swear her eyes exceeded modern eyes  When poets sung for her  and lovers bled  And giddy fashion follow as she led  Departed modes appear in long array  The flowers and flounces of her happier day   Again her locks the decent fillets bind  The waving lappet flutters in the wind  And then comparing with a proud disdain The more fantastic tastes that now obtain  She deems ungraceful  trifling and absurd  The gayer world that moves round George the Third  Nor thy soft influence will the train refuse  Who court in distant shades the modest Muse  Tho  in a form more pure and more refined  Thy soothing spirit meets the letter mind  Not Death itself thine empire can destroy   Tow rds thee  even then  we turn the languid eye   Still trust in thee to bid our memory bloom  And scatter roses round the filent tomb
