 FAREWEL  Aruna   on whose varied shore My early vows were paid to Nature shrine  When thoughtle  joy  and infant hope were mine  And whose lorn stream has heard me since deplore Too many sorrows  Sighing I resign Thy folitary beauties and no more Or on thy rocks  or in thy woods recline  Or on the heath  by moonlight lingering  pore On air drawn phantoms While in Fancy ear As in the evening wind thy murmurs swell  The Enthusiast of the Lyre who wander here  Seems yet to strike his visionary shell  Of power to call forth Pity tenderest tear  Or wake wild frenzy from her hideous cell
