 I LOVE thee  mournful  sober suited Night  When the faint Moon  yet lingering in her wane  And veil in clouds  with pale uncertain light Hangs over the waters of the restle  main  In deep depre ion sunk  the enfeebled mind Will to the deaf cold elements complain  And tell the embosom grief  however vain  To sullen surges and the viewle  wind  Tho  no repose on thy dark breast I find  I still enjoy thee cheerle  as thou art   For in thy quiet gloom the exhausted heart Is calm  tho  wretched   hopele   yet resign  While to the winds and waves its sorrows given  May reach tho  lost on earth the ear of Heaven
