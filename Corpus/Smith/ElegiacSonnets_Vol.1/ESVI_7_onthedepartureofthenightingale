 Sweet poet of the woodsa long adieu   Farewel  foft minstrel of the early year  Ah   twill be long ere thou shalt sing anew  And pour thy music on the night dull ear   Whether on Spring thy wandering flights await  Or whether filent in our groves you dwell  The pensive muse shall own thee for her mate  And still protect the song she loves so well  With cautious step  the love lorn youth shall glide Thro  the lone brake that shades thy moffy nest  And shepherd girls  from eyes profane fall hide The gentle bird  who sings of pity best   For still thy voice shall soft affections move  And still be dear to forrow  and to love
