 Ah  wherefore do the incurious say  That this stupendous ocean wide  No change presents from day to day  Save only the alternate tide   Or save when gales of summer glide Acro  the lightly crisped wave  Or  when against the cliff  rough side  As equinoctial tempests rave  It wildly bursts  erwhelins the deluged strand  Tears down its bounds  and desolates the land  He who with more enquiring eyes Doth this extensive scene survey  Beholds innumerous changes rise  As various winds its surface sway  Now er its heaving bosom play Small sparkling waves of silver gleam  And as they lightly glide away Illume with fluctuating beam The deepening surge  green as the dewy corn That undulates in April  breezy morn  The far off waters then a ume A glowing amethystine shade  That changing like the peacock  plume  Seems in celestial blue to fade  Or paler  colder hues of lead  As lurid vapours float on high  Along the ruffling billows spread  While darkly lours the threatening sky  And the small scatter barks with outspread shrouds  Catch the long gleams  that fall between the clouds  Then day  bright star with blunted rays Seems struggling thro  the sea fog pale  And doubtful in the heavy haze  Is dimly seen the nearing sail    Till from the land a fresher gale Disperses the white mist  and clear  As melts away the gauzy veil  The sun reflecting waves appear  So  brighter genuine virtue seems to rise From envy  dark invidious calumnies  What glories on the sun attend  When the full tides of evening flow  Where in still changing beauty  blend With amber light  the opal  glow  While in the east the diamond bow Rises in virgin lustre bright  And from the horizon seems to throw  A partial line of trembling light To the hush shore  and all the tranquil deep Beneath the modest moon  is sooth to sleep  Forgotten then  the thundering break Of waves  that in the tempest rise   The falling cliff  the shatter wreck  The howling blast  the sufferer  cries  For soft the breeze of evening sighs  And murmuring seems in Fancy  ear To whisper fairy lullabies  That tributary waters bear From precipices  dark with piny woods  And inland rocks  and heathy solitudes  The vast encircling seas within  What endle  swarms of creatures hide  Of burnish scale  and spiny fin  These providential instincts guide  And bid them know the annual tide  When  from unfathom waves that swell  Beyond Fuego  stormy side  They come  to cheer the tribes that dwell In Boreal climes  and thro  his half year  night Give to the Lapland savage  food and light  From cliffs  that pierce the northern sky  Where eagles rear their sanguine brood  With long awaiting patient eye  Baffled by many a sailing cloud  The Highland native marks the flood  Till bright the quickening billows roll  And hosts of sea birds  clamouring loud  Track with wild wing the welcome shoal  Swift er the animated current sweep    And bear their silver captives from the deep  Sons of the North  your streamy vales With no rich sheaves rejoice and sing  Her flowery robe no fruit conceals  Tho sweetly smile your tardy spring   Yet every mountain  clothed with ling  Doth from its purple brow  survey Your busy sails  that ceasele  bring To the broad frith  and sheltering bay  Riches  by Heaven  parental power supplied    The harvest of the far embracing tide  And  where those fractur mountains lift O er the blue wave their towering crest  Each salient ledge and hollow cleft To sea fowl give a rugged nest  But with instinctive love is drest The Eider  downy cradle  where The mother bird  her glo y breast Devotes  and with maternal care  And plumele  bosom  stems the toiling seas  That foam round the tempestuous Orcades  From heights  whence shuddering sense recoils  And cloud capped headlands  steep and bare  Sons of the North  your venturous toils Collect your poor and scanty fare  Urged by imperious Want  you dare Scale the loose cliff  where Gannets hide  Or scarce suspended  in the air Hang perilous   and thus provide The soft voluptuous couch  which not secures To Luxury  pamper minions  sleep like yours  Revolving still  the waves that now Just ripple on the level shore  Have borne perchance the Indian  prow  Or half congeal  Ê¼mid ice rocks hoar  Raved to the Walrus  hollow roar  Or have by currents swift convey To the cold coast of Labrador  The relics of the tropic shade  And to the wondering Esquimaux have shown Leaves of strange shape  and fruits unlike their own  No more then  let the incurious say  No change this world of water shows  But as the tides the moon obey  Or tempests rave  or calms repose  Shew them  its bounteous breast bestows On myriads life  and bid them see In every wave that circling flows  Beauty and use  and harmony Works of the Power Supreme  who poured the flood  Round the green peopled earth  and call it good
