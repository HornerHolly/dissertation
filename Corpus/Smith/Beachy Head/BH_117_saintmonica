 Among deep woods is the dismantled scite Of an old Abbey  where the chaunted rite  By twice ten brethren of the monkish cowl  Was duly sung  and requiems for the soul Of the first founder   For the lordly chief  Who flourish paramount of many a fief  Left here a stipend yearly paid  that they  The pious monks  for his repose might say Ma  and orisons to Saint Monica   Beneath the falling archway overgrown With briars  a bench remains  a single stone  Where sat the indigent  to wait the dole Given at the buttery  that the baron  soul  The poor might intercede for  there would rest  Known by his hat of straw with cockles drest  And staff and humble weed of watchet gray  The wandering pilgrim  who came there to pray The interce ion of Saint Monica  Stern Reformation and the lapse of years llave reft the windows  and no more appears Abbot or martyr on the gla  anneal  And half the falling cloisters are conceal By ash and elder   the refectory wall Oft in the storm of night is heard to fall  When  wearied by the labours of the day  The half awaken cotters  starting say    It is the ruins of Saint Monica   Now with approaching rain is heard the rill  Just trickling thro  a deep and hollow gill By osiers  and the alder  crowding bush  Reeds  and dwarf elder  and the pithy rush  Choak and impeded   to the lower ground Slowly it creeps   there traces still are found Of hollow squares  embank with beaten clay  Where brightly glitter in the eye of day The peopled waters of Saint Monica   The chapel pavement  where the name and date  Or monkish rhyme  had mark the graven plate  With docks and nettles now is overgrown  And brambles trail above the dead unknown   Impatient of the heat  the straggling ewe Tinkles her drowsy bell  as nibbling slow She picks the gra  among the thistles gray  Whose feather seed the light air bears away  er the pale relicks of Saint Monica  Reecho by the walls  the owl obscene Hoots to the night  as thro  the ivy green Whose matted tods the arch and buttre  bind  Sobs in low gusts the melancholy wind  The Conium there  her stalks bedropp with red  Rears  with Circea  neighbour of the dead  Atropa too  that  as the beldams say  Shews her black fruit to tempt and to betray  Nods by the mouldering shrine of Monica  Old tales and legends are not quite forgot  Still Superstition hovers er the spot  And tells how here  the wan and restle  sprite  By some way wilder peasant seen at night  Gibbers and shrieks  among the ruins drear  And how the friar  lanthorn will appear Gleaming among the woods  with fearful ray  And from the church yard take its wavering way  To the dim arches of Saint Monica  The antiquary comes not to explore  As once  the unrafter roof and pathle  floor  For now  no more beneath the vaulted ground Is crosier  cro   or sculptur chalice found  Nor record telling of the wa ail ale  What time the welcome summons to regale  Given by the matin peal on holiday  The villagers rejoicing to obey  Feasted  in honour of Saint Monica  Yet often still at eve  or early morn  Among these ruins shagg with fern and thorn  A pensive stranger from his lonely seat Observes the rapid martin  threading fleet The broken arch  or follows with his eye  The wall creeper that hunts the burnish fly  Sees the newt basking in the sunny ray  Or snail that sinuous winds his shining way  er the time fretted walls of Monica  He comes not here  from the sepulchral stone To tear the oblivious pall that Time has thrown  But meditating  marks the power proceed From the mapped lichen  to the plumed weed  From thready mo es to the veined flower  The silent  slow  but ever active power Of Vegetative Life  that er Decay Weaves her green mantle  when returning May Dre es the ruins of Saint Monica  Oh Nature  ever lovely  ever new  He whom his earliest vows has paid to you Still finds  that life has something to bestow  And while to dark Forgetfulne  they go  Man  and the works of man  immortal Youth  Unfading Beauty  and eternal Truth  Your Heaven indited volume will display  While Art  elaborate monuments decay  Even as these shatter aisles  deserted Monica
