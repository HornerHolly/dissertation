 Trust only to thyself   the maxim sound  For  tho  life choicest ble ing be a friend  Friends do not very much abound  Or  where they happen to be found  And greatly thou on friendship shouldst depend  Thou lt find it will not bear Much wear and tear  Nay  that even kindred  cousin  uncle  brother  Has each perhaps to mind his own affair   Attend to thine then   lean not on another  Esop a ures us that the maxim wise e  And by a tale illustrates his advice   When April bright and fickle beams Saw every feather pair In the green woodlands  or by willowy streams  Busied in matrimonial schemes   A Lark  amid the dewy air  Woo  and soon won a favourite fair   And  in a spot by springing rye protected  Her labour sometimes shared   While she  with bents  and wither gra  collected  Their humble domicile prepared   Then  by her duty fix  the tender mate Unwearied prest Their future progeny beneath her breast  And little slept  and little ate  While her gay lover  with a carele  heart  As is the custom of his sex  Full little recks The coming family  but like a dart  From his low homested  with the morning springs  And far above the floating vapour  sings At such an height  That even the shepherd lad upon the hill  Hearing his matin note so shrill  With shaded eyes against the lustre bright  Scarce sees him twinkling in a flood of light  But hunger  spite of all her perseverance  Was one day urgent on his patient bride   The truant made not his appearance  That her fond care might be a while supplied    So  because hunger will not be denied  She leaves her nest reluctant  and in haste But just allows herself to taste  A dew drop  and a few small seeds Ah  how her fluttering bosom bleeds  When the dear cradle she had fondly rear All desolate appear  And ranging wide about the field she saw A setter huge  whose unrelenting jaw Had crush her half existing young  Long er her ruin hopes the mother hung  And vainly mourn  Ere from the clouds her wanderer return  Tears justly shed by beauty  who can stand them  He heard her plaintive tale with unfeign sorrow  But  as his motto was   Nil desperandum   Bade her hope better fortune for to morrow  Then from the fatal spot afar  they sought A safer shelter  having bought Experience  which is always rather dear   And very near A gra y headland  in a field of wheat  They fix  with cautious care  their second seat But this took time  May was already past  The white thorn had her silver blo oms cast  And there the Nightingale  to lovely June  ller last farewell had sung   No longer reign July intemperate noon  And high in heaven the reaper moon  A little crescent hung  Ere from their shells appear the plumele  young  Oh  then with how much tender care  The busy pair  Watch and provided for the panting brood  For then  the vagrant of the air  Soar not to meet the morning star  1 But  never from the nestlings far  Explor each furrow  every sod for food  While his more anxious partner tried From hostile eyes  the helple  group to hide  Attempting now  with labouring bill  to guide The enwreathing bindweed round the nest  Now joy to see the cornflower azure erest Above it waving  and the cockle grow  Or poppies throw Their scarlet curtains round  While the more humble children of the ground  Freak pansics  fumitory  pimpernel  Circled with arras light  the secret cell    But who against all evils can provide   Hid  and overshadow thus  and fortified  By teasel  and the scabious  thready disk  Corn marygold  and thistles  too much risk The little household still were doom to run  For the same ardent sun  Whose beams had drawn up many an idle flower  To fence the lonely bower  Had by his powerful heat  Matured the wheat   And chang of hue  it hung its heavy head  While every rustling gale that blew along From neighbouring uplands  brought the rustic song Of harvest merriment  then full of dread  Lest  not yet fully fledg  her race The reaper foot might crush  or reaper dog might trace  Or village child  too young to reap or bind  Loitering around  her hidden treasure find  The mother bird was bent To move them  e er the sickle came more near  And therefore  when for food abroad she went   For now her mate again was on the ramble  She bade her young report what they should hear   So the next hour they cried     They ll all a emble    The farmer neighbours  with the dawn of light    Therefore  dear mother  let us move to night     Fear not  my loves   said she    you need not tremble    Trust me  if only neighbours are in question    Eat what I bring  and spoil not your digestion   Or sleep  for this   Next day away she flew  And that no neighbour came was very true  But her returning wings the Larklings knew  And quivering round her  told  their landlord said    Why  John  the reaping must not be delay  By peep of day to morrow we ll begin    Since now so many of our kin   Have promis us their help to set about it     Still   quoth the bird   I doubt it     The corn will stand to morrow   So it prov   The morning dawn arriv but never saw Or uncle  cousin  brother  or brother in law  And not a reap hook mov   Then to his son the angry farmer cried    Some folks are little known  till they are tried     Who would have thought we had so few well wishers     What  neither neighbour Dawes  nor cousin Fishers    Nor uncle Betts  nor even my brother Delves    Will lend an hand  to help us get the corn in     Well then  let you and me  to morrow morning    E en try what we can do with it ourselves     Nay   quoth the Lark     tis time then to be gone     What a man undertakes himself is done   Certes  she was a bird of observation  For very true it is  that none  Whatever be his station  Lord of a province  tenant of a mead  Whether he fill a cottage  or a throne  Or guard a flock  or guide a nation  Is very likely to succeed  Who manages affairs by deputation
