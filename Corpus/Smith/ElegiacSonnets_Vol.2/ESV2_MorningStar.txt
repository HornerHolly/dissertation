THEE   lucid arbiter   twixt day and night  
The seaman greets   as on the Ocean stream
Reflected   thy precursive friendly beam
Points out the long  fought haven to his fight  
Watching for thee   the lover ardent eyes
Turn to the eastern hills    and as above
Thy brilliance trembles   hails the lights that rise
To guide his footsteps to expecting love   
I mark thee too   as night dark clouds retire  
And thy bright radiance glances on the sea   
But never more shall thy heraldic fire
speak of approaching morn with joy to me  
Quenched in the gloom of death that heavenly ray
Once lent to light me on my thorny way
