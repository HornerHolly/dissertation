THOU   whom Prosperity has always led
over level paths   with moss and flowerets strewn  
For whom she still prepares a downy bed
With roses scattered   and to thorns unknown  
Wilt thou yet murmur at a mis  placed leaf   
Think   ere thy irritable nerves repine  
How many   born with feelings keen as thine  
Taste all the sad vicissitudes of grief   
How many steep in tears their scanty bread  
Or   loft to reason   sorrow victims    rave  
How many know not where to lay their head   
While some are driven by anguish to the grave  
Think   nor impatient at a feather weight  
Mar the uncommon blessings of thy fate
