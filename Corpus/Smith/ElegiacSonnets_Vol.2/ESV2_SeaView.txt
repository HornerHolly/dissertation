THE upland shepherd   as reclined he lies
On the soft turf that clothes the mountain brow  
Marks the bright sea  line mingling with the skies   
Or from his course celestial   sinking slow  
The summer  sun in purple radiance low  
Blaze on the western waters   the wide scene
Magnificent   and tranquil   seems to spread
Even over the Rustic breast a joy serene  
When   like dark plague  spots by the Demons shed  
Charged deep with death   upon the waves   far seen  
Move the war  freighted ships   and fierce and red  
Flash their destructive fires  The mangled dead   
And dying victims then pollute the flood  
Ah   thus man spoils Heaven glorious works with blood
