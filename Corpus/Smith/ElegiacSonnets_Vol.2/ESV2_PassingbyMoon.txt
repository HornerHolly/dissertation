WHILE thus I wander   cheerless and unblest  
And find in change of place but change of pain  
In tranquil sleep the village labourers rest  
And taste that quiet I pursue in vain   
Hushed is the hamlet now   and faintly gleam
The dying embers   from the casement low
Of the thatched cottage    while the Moon wan beam
Lends a new lustre to the dazzling snow
over the cold waste   amid the freezing night  
scarce heeding whither   desolate I stray   
For me   pale Eye of Evening   thy soft light
Leads to no happy home   my weary way
Ends but in fad vicissitudes of care  
I only fly from doubt  to meet despair
