MIRANDA  mark where shrinking from the gale 
Its silken leaves yet moist with early dew 
That fair faint flower  the Lily of the Vale
Droops its meek head  and looks  methinks  like you 
Wrapped in a shadowy veil of tender green 
Its snowy bells a soft perfume dispense 
And bending as reluctant to be seen   
In simple loveliness it fooths the sense 
With bosom bared to meet the garish day 
The glaring Tulip  gaudy  undismayed 
Offends the eye of taste   that turns away
To seek the Lily in her fragrant shade 
With such unconscious beauty  pensive  mild 
Miranda charms Nature s soft modest child
