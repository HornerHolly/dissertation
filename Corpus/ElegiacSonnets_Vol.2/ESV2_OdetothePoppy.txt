Not for the promise of the laboured field  
Not for the good the yellow harvests yield  
I bend at Ceres   shrine     
For dull   to humid eyes   appear
The golden glories of the year  
Alas     a melancholy worship mine  

I hail the goddess for her scarlet flower  
Thou brilliant weed  
That dost so far exceed
The richest gifts gay Flora can bestow   
Heedless I passed thee   in life  s morning hour  
  Thou comforter of woe  
Till forrow taught me to confess thy power  
In early days   when Fancy cheats  
A varied wreath I wove
Of laughing spring  s luxuriant sweets  
To deck ungrateful Love  
The rose   or thorn   my labours crowned  
As Venus smiled   or Venus frowned    

But Love   and Joy   and all their train   are flown       
Even languid Hope no more is mine  
And I will sing of thee alone  
Unless   perchance   the attributes of Grief  
The cypress bud   and willow leaf  
Their pale funereal foliage blend with thine  
Hail   lovely blossom     thou canst ease
The wretched victims of Disease   
Canst close those weary eyes in gentle sleep  
Which never open but to weep  
For   oh   thy potent charm
Can agonizing Pain disarm   
Expel imperious Memory from her seat  
And bid the throbbing heart forget to beat  

soul  soothing plant    that can such blessings give  
By thee the mourner bears to live  
By thee the hopeless die   
Oh   ever    friendly to despair    
Might sorrow pallid votary dare  
Without a crime   that remedy implore  
Which bids the spirit from its bondage fly  
Ied court thy palliative aid no more   
No more Ied sue that thou shouldst spread  
Thy spell around my aching head  
But would conjure thee to impart
Thy balsam for a broken heart   
And by thy soft Lethean power  
  Inestimable flower  
Burst these terrestrial bonds   and other regions try
