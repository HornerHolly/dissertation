WHATEVER of praise   and of regret attend
The grateful servant   and the humble friend  
Where strict integrity and worth unite
To raise the lowly in their Maker  fight  
Are her  whose faithful service   long approved  
Wept by the Mistress whom thro   life she loved  
Here ends her earthly task   in joyful trust
To share the eternal triumph of the Just
