FRIEND of the wretched   wherefore should the eye
Of blank Despair   whence tears have ceased to flow  
Be turned from thee    Ah   wherefore fears to die
He   who compellid each poignant grief to know  
Drains to its lowest dregs the cup of woe   
Would Cowardice postpone thy calm embrace  
To linger out long years in torturing pain   
Or not prefer thee to the ills that chase
Him   who too much impoverished to obtain
From British Themis right   implores her aid in
vain   

sharp goading Indigence who would not fly  
That urges toil the exhausted strength above   
Or shun the once fond friend  s averted eye   
Or who to thy afylum not remove  
To lose the wasting anguish of ungrateful love   
Can then the wounded wretch who must deplore   
What most she loved   to thy cold arms consigned  
Who hears the voice that soothed her soul no more  
Fear thee   O Death     Or hug the chains that bind
To joyless   cheerless life   her fick   reluctant mind  

Oh   Misery Cure   who ever in pale dismay
Has watched the angel form they could not fave  
And seen their dearest blessing torn away  
May well the terrors of thy triumph brave  
Nor pause in fearful dread before the opening grave
