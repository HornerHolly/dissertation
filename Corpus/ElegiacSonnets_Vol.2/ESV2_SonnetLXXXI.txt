He may be envied   who with tranquil breast
Can wander in the wild and woodland scene  
When summer  glowing hands have newly drest
The shadowy forests   and the copses green   
Who   unpursued by care   can pass his hours  
Where briony and woodbine fringe the trees  
On thymy banks reposing   while the bees
Murmur    their fairy tunes in praise of flowers     
Or on the rock with ivy clad   and fern
That overhangs the ozier  whispering bed
Of some clear current   bid his wishes turn
From this bad world   and by calm reason led  
Knows   in refined retirement   to possess
By friendship hallowed  rural happiness
