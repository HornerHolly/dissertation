LIKE a poor ghost the night I seek   
Its hollow winds repeat my sighs  
The cold dews mingle on my cheek
With tears that wander   from mine eyes  
The thorns that still my couch molest  
Have robbed these heavy eyes of sleep   
But tho   deprived of tranquil rest  
I here at least am free to weep  

Twelve times the moon   that rises red
over yon tall wood of shadowy pine  
Has filled her orb   fince low was laid
My Harriet    that sweet form of thine  
  
While each sad month   as slow it past  
Brought some new sorrow to deplore   
some grief more poignant than the last  
But thou canst calm those griefs no more    
  
No more thy friendship fooths to rest
oths to relti
This wearied spirit tempest  tost  
   The cares that weigh upon my breast
Are doubly felt since thou art loft  

Bright visions of ideal grace
That the young poet dreams inflame  
Were not more lovely than thy face   
Were not more perfeet than thy frame  
Wit   that no sufferings could impair  
Was thine   and thine those mental powers
Of force to chase the fiends that tear
From Fancy  s hands her budding flowers  
over what   my angel friend   thou wert  
Dejected Memory loves to mourn  
Regretting still that tender heart  
Now withering in a distant urn  

But ere that wood of shadowy pine
Twelve times shall yon full orb behold  
This fickening heart   that bleeds for thine  
My Harriet     may like thine be cold
