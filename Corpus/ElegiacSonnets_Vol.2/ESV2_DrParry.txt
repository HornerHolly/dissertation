IN happier hours   ere yet so keenly blew
Adversity cold blight   and bitter storms  
Luxuriant summer evanescent forms  
And spring soft blooms with pencil light I drew   
But as the lovely family of flowers
shrink from the bleakness of the Northern blast  
so fail from present care and sorrow past
The flight botanic pencil mimic powers  
Nor will kind Fancy even by Memory aid  
Her visionary garlands now entwine   
Yet while the wreaths of Hope and Pleasure fade  
still is one flower of deathless blossom mine  
That dares the lapse of Time   and Tempest rude  
The unfading Amaranth of Gratitude
