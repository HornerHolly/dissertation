sWELLs then thy feeling heart   and streams thine eye
over the deserted being   poor and old  
Whom cold   reluctant   Parish Charity
Consigns to mingle with his kindred mold  
Mournst thou   that here the time  worn sufferer ends
Those evil days still threatening woes to come   
Here   where the friendless feel no want of friends  
Where even the houseless wanderer finds an home  

What tho   no kindred croud in fable forth  
And sigh   or seem to sigh   around his bier   
Tho over his coffin with the humid earth
No children drop the unavailing tear  
Rather rejoice that here his sorrows cease  
Whom sickness   age   and poverty oppressed  
Where Death   the Leveller   restores to peace
The wretch who living knew not where to rest  
Rejoice   that tho   an outcast spurned by Fate  
Thro   penury  rugged path his race he ran   
In earth   cold bosom   equalled with the great  
Death vindicates the insulted rights of Man  

Rejoice   that tho   severe his earthly doom  
And rude   and fown with thorns the way he trod  
Now     where unfeeling Fortune cannot come  
He rests upon the mercies of his God
