sWEET age of blest delusion   blooming boys  
Ah   revel long in childhood thoughtless joys  
With light and pliant fpirits   that can stoop
To follow   sportively   the rolling hoop  
To watch the sleeping top with gay delight  
Or mark   with raptured gaze   the failing kite   
Or   eagerly pursuing Pleasure call  
Can find it centered in the bounding ball   
Alas   the day will come   when sports like these
Must lose their magic   and their power to please   
Too swiftly fled   the rosy hours of youth
shall yield their fairy  charms to mournful Truth   

Even now   a mother fond prophetic fear
sees the dark train of human ills appear   
Views various fortune for each lovely child  
storms for the bold   and anguish for the mild   
Beholds already those expressive eyes
Beam a sad certainty of future fighs   
And dreads each suffering those dear breasts may know
In their long passage through a world of woe   
Perchance predestined every pang to prove  
That treacherous friends inflict   or faithless love   
For   ah   how few have found existence sweet  
Where grief is sure   but happiness deceit
