WHERE the wild woods and pathless forests frown  
The darkling Pilgrim seeks his unknown way  
Till on the grass he throws him weary down  
To wait in broken seep the dawn of day   
Thro   boughs just waving in the filent air  
With pale capricious light the summer Moon
Chequers his humid couch    while Fancy there  
That loves to wanton in the Night deep noon  
Calls from the mossy roots and fountain edge
Fair visionary Nymphs that haunt the shade  
Or Naiads rising from the whispering sedge   
And     mid the beauteous group   his dear loved maid
seems beckoning him with smiles to join the train   
Then   starting from his dream   he feels his woes again
