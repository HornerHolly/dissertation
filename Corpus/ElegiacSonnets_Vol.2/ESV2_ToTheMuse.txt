Wilt thou forsake me who in life bright May
Lent warmer lustre to the radiant morn   
And even over summer scenes by tempests torn  
shed with illusive light the dewy ray
Of pensive pleasure     Wilt thou   while the day
Of faddening Autumn closes   as I mourn
In languid   hopeless sorrow   far away
Bend thy soft step   and never more return     
Crushed to the earth   by bitterest anguish prest  
From my faint eyes thy graceful form recedes   
Thou canst not heal an heart like mine that bleeds   
But   when in quiet earth that heart shall rest  
Haply mayst thou one sorrowing vigil keep  
Where Pity and Remembrance bend and weep
