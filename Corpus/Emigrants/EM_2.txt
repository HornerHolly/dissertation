LONG wintry months are past  the Moon that now Lights her pale crescent even at noon  has made Four times her revolution   fince with step  Mournful and slow  along the wave worn cliff  Pensive I took my solitary way  Lost in despondence  while contemplating Not my own wayward destiny alone   Hard as it is  and difficult to bear   But in beholding the unhappy lot Of the lorn Exiles  who  amid the storms Of wild disastrous Anarchy  are thrown  Like shipwrecked sufferers  on England coast  To see  perhaps  no more their native land  Where Desolation riots  They  like me  From fairer hopes and happier prospects driven  shrink from the future  and regret the past  But on this Upland scene  while April comes  With fragrant airs  to fan my throbbing breast  Fain would I snatch an interval from Care  That weighs my wearied spirit down to earth  Courting  once more  the influence of Hope  For  Hope  still waits upon the flowery prime  As here I mark springs humid hand unfold The early leaves that fear capricious winds  While  even on sheltered banks  the timid flowers Give  half reluctantly  their warmer hues To mingle with the primroses  pale stars  No shade the leafles  copses yet afford  Nor hide the mossy labours of the Thrush  That  startled  darts across the narrow path  But quickly re assur d  resumes his task  Or adds his louder notes to those that rise From yonder tufted brake  where the white buds Of the first thorn are mingled with the leaves Of that which blossoms on the brow of May  Ah it will not be   so many years have passed  since  on my native hills  I learned to gaze On these delightful landscapes  and those years Have taught me so much sorrow  that my soul Feels not the joy reviving Nature brings  But  in dark retrospect  dejected dwells On human follies  and on human woes  What is the promise of the infant year  The lively verdure  or the bursting blooms  To those  who shrink from horrors such as War spreads over the affrighted world  With swimming eye  Back on the past they throw their mournful looks  And see the Temple  which they fondly hoped Reason would raise to Liberty  destroyed By ruffian hands  while  on the ruined mass  Flushed with hot blood  the Fiend of Discord fits In savage triumph   mocking every plea Of policy and justice  as she shews The headless corse of one  whose only crime Was being born a Monarch Mercy turns  From spectacle so dire  her swol n eyes  And Liberty  with calm  unruffled brow Magnanimous  as conscious of her strength In Reason panoply  scorns to distain Her righteous cause with ams  and resigns To Fraud and Anarchy the infuriate crowd  What is the promise of the infant year To those  who  while the poor but peaceful hind Pens  unmolested  the encreasing flock Of his rich master in this sea fenced isle  survey  in neighbouring countries  scenes that make The fick heart shudder  and the Man  who thinks  Blush for his species   There the tumor  voice Drowns the soft warbling of the woodland choir  And violets  lurking in their turfy beds Beneath the flowering thorn  are stained with blood  There fall  at once  the spoiler and the spoiled  While War  wide ravaging  annihilates The hope of cultivation  gives to Fiends  The meagre  ghastly Fiends of Want and Woe  The blasted land There  taunting in the van Of vengeance breathing armies  Insult stalks  And  in the ranks      Famine  and sword  and Fire   Crouch for employment   Lo  the suffering world  Torn by the fearful conflićt  shrinks  amazed  From Freedom name  usurped and misapplied  And  cowering to the purple Tyrants rod  Deems that the lesser ill Deluded Men Ere ye prophane her ever glorious name  Or catalogue the thousands that have bled Resisting her  or those  who greatly died Martyrs to Liberty revert awhile To the black scroll  that tells of regal crimes Committed to destroy her  rather count The hecatombs of vićtims  who have fallen Beneath a single despot  or who gave Their wasted lives for some disputed claim Between anointed robbers   Monsters both      Oh Polished perturbation golden care s  so strangely coveted by feeble Man  To lift him over his fellows  Toy  for which such showers of blood have drenched th  affrighted earth  Unfortunate his lot  whose luckless head Thy jeweled circlet  lined with thorns  has bound  And who  by custom s laws  obtains from thee   Hereditary right to rule  unchecked  submissive myini  for untempered power  Like steel ill form d  injures the hand It promised to protećt Unhappy Francel If ever thy lilies  trampled now in dust  And  blood bespotted  shall again revive In silver splendour  may the wreath be woven By voluntary hands  and Freemen  such As England self might boast  unite to place The guarded diadem on his fair brow  Where Loyalty may join with Liberty To fix it firmly  In the rugged school Of stern Adversity so early trained  His future life  perchance  may emulate That of the brave Bernois   so justly called The darling of his people  who revered The Warrior less  than they adored the Man I But never may Party Rage  perverse and blind  And base Venality  prevail to raise To public trust  a wretch  whose private vice Makes even the wildest profligate recoil  And who  with hireling ruffians leagued  has burst The laws of Nature and Humanity Wading  beneath the Patriot specious mask  And in Equality illusive name  To empire thro  a stream of kindred blood  Innocent prisoner l most unhappy heir Of fatal greatness  who art suffering now For all the crimes and follies of thy race  Better for thee  if over thy baby brow The regal mischief never had been held   Then  in an humble sphere  perhaps content  Thou hadst been free and joyous on the heights Of Pyrennean mountains  shagged with woods Of chesnut  pine  and oak  as on these hills Is yonder little thoughtless shepherd lad  Who  on the slope abrupt of downy turf Reclined in playful indolence  sends off The chalky ball  quick bounding far below  While  half forgetful of his simple task  Hardly his lengthening shadow  or the bells  slow tinkling of his flock  that supping tend To the brown fallows in the vale beneath  Where nightly it is folded  from his sport Recal the happy idler  While I gaze On his gay vacant countenance  my thoughts Compare with his obscure  laborious lot  Thine  most unfortunate  imperial Boy  Who round thy sullen prison daily hearst The savage howl of Murder  as it seeks Thy unoffending life  while sad within Thy wretched Mother  petrified with grief  Views thee with stony eyes  and cannot weep Ah  much I mourn thy sorrows  hapless Queen  And deem thy expiation made to Heaven For every fault  to which Prosperity Betrayed thee  when it placed thee on a throne Where boundless power was thine  and thou wert raised High  as it seemed  above the envious reach Of destiny | Whatever thy errors were  Be they no more remembered  tho  the rage Of Party swelled them to such crimes  as bade Compassion flie every figh that rose For thy disastrous lot More than enough Thou hast endured  and every English heart  Even those  that highest beat in Freedom cause  Disclaim as base  and of that cause unworthy  The Vengeance  or the Fear  that makes thee still A miserable prisoner  Ah  who knows From sad experience  more than I  to feel   For thy desponding spirit  as it sinks Beneath procrastinated fears for those More dear to thee than life But eminence Of misery is thine  as once of joy  And  as we view the strange vicissitude  We ask anew  where happiness is found Alas  in rural life  where youthful dreams see the Arcadia that Romance describes  Not even Content resides  In yon low hut Of clay and thatch  where rises the grey smoke Of smoldering turf  cut from the adjoining moor  The labourer  its inhabitant  who toils From the first dawn of twilight  till the sun sinks in the rosy waters of the West  Finds that with poverty it cannot dwell  For bread  and scanty bread  is all he earns For him and for his household should Disease  Born of chill wintry rains  arrest his arm  Then  thro  his patched and straw stuffed casement  peeps The squalid figure of extremest Want  And from the Parish the reluctant dole  Dealt by th  unfeeling farmer  hardly saves The ling ring spark of life from cold extinétion  Then the bright sun of spring  that smiling bids All other animals rejoice  beholds  Crept from his pallet  the emaciate wretch Attempt  with feeble effort  to resume some heavy task  above his wasted strength  Turning his wistful looks  how much in vain   To the deserted mansion  where no more The owner  gone to gayer scenes  resides Who made even luxury  Virtue  while he gave The scattered crumbs to honest Poverty   But  tho  the landscape be too oft deformed By figures such as these  yet Peace is here  And over our vallies  cloathed with springing corn  No hostile hoof shall trample  nor fierce flames Wither the wood young verdure  ere it form Gradual the laughing May luxuriant shade  For  by the rude sea guarded  we are safe  And feel not evils such as with deep fighs The Emigrants deplore  as they recal The summer past  when Nature seemed to lose Her course in wild distemperature  and aid  With seasons all reversed  destructive War  shuddering  I view the pićtures they have drawn Of desolated countries  where the ground  stripped of its unripe produce  was thick strewn With various Death the war horse falling there By famine  and his rider by the sword  The moping clouds sailed heavy charg d with rain  And busing over the mountains misty brow  Deluged  as with an inland sea  the vales   Where  thro  the sullen evening lurid gloom  Rising  like columns of volcanic fire  The flames of burning villages illumed The waste of water  and the wind  that howled Along its troubled surface  brought the groans Of plundered peasants  and the frantic shrieks of mothers for their children  while the brave  To pity still alive  listened aghast To these dire echoes  hopeless to prevent The evils they beheld  or check the rage  Which ever  as the people of one land Meet in contention  fires the human heart With savage thirst of kindred blood  and makes Man lose his nature  rendering him more fierce Than the gaunt monsters of the howling waste  Oft have I heard the melancholy tale  Which  all their native gaiety forgot These Exiles tell How Hope impelled them on  Reckless of tempest  hunger  or the sword  Till ordered to retreat  they knew not why  From all their flattering prospects  they became The prey of dark suspicion and regret    Then  in despondence  sunk the unnerved arm Of gallant Loyalty At every turn same and disgrace appeared  and seemed to mock Their scattered squadrons  which the warlike youth  Unable to endure   often implored  As the last act of friendship  from the hand Of some brave comrade  to receive the blow That freed the indignant spirit from its pain  To a wild mountain  whos  bare summit hides Its broken eminence in clouds  whose steeps Are dark with woods  where the receding rocks Are worn by torrents of dissolving show  A wretched Woman  pale and breathless  flies And  gazing round her  listens to the sound Of hostile footsteps No  it dies away  Nor noise remains  but of the cataraćt  Or surly breeze of night  that mutters low Among the thickets  where she trembling seeks A temporary shelter clasping close To her hard heaving heart her sleeping child  All she could rescue of the innocent groupe That yesterday surrounded her Escaped Almost by miracle   Fear  frantic Fear  Winged her weak feet  yet  half repentant now Her headlong haste  she wishes she had staid To die with those affrighted Fancy paints The lawless soldier vićtims Hark  again The driving tempest bears the cry of Death  And  with deep sudden thunder  the dread sound Of cannon vibrates on the tremulous earth  While  bursting in the air  the murderous bomb Glares over her mansion  Where the splinters fall  Like scattered comets  its destructive path Is marked by wreaths of flame   Then  overwhelm d Beneath accumulated horror  sinks The desolate mourner  yet  in Death itself  True to maternal tenderness  she tries To save the unconscious infant from the storm In which she perishes  and to protect This last dear object of her ruin d hopes From prowling monsters  that from other hills  More inaccessible  and wilder wastes  Lured by the scent of slaughter  follow fierce Contending hosts  and to polluted fields Add dire increase of horrors But alas   The Mother and the Infant perish both   The feudal Chief  whose Gothic battlements Frown on the plain beneath  returning home From distant lands  alone and in disguise  Gains at the fall of night his Castle walls  But  at the vacant gate  no Porter fits To wait his Lord admittance In the courts All is drear filence  Guessing but too well The fatal truth  he shudders as he goes Thro  the mute hall  where  by the blunted light That the dim moon thro  painted casements lends  He sees that devastation has been there  Then  while each hideous image to his mind Rises terrific  over a bleeding corse stumbling he falls  another intempt  His staggering feet all  all who us d to rush   With joy to meet him all his fimily Lie murdered in his way   And the day dawns On a wild raving Maniac  whom a fate so sudden and calamitous has robbed Of reason  and who round his vacant walls screams unregarded  and reproaches Heaven l  such are thy dreadful trophies  savage War I   And evils such as these  or yet more dire  Which the pained mind recoils from  all are thine  The purple Pedience  that to the grave sends whom the sword has spar d  is thine  and thine   The Widow anguish and the Orphan tears   Woes such as these does Man inflićt on Man  And by the closet murder  whom we style Wise Politicians  are the schemes prepared  Which  to keep Europe wavering balance even  Depopulate her kingdoms  and consign To tears and anguish half a bleeding world    Oh  could the time return  when thoughts like these spoiled not that gay delight  which vernal suns  Illuminating hills  and woods  and fields  Gave to my infant spirits Memory come   And from distrading cares  that now deprive such scenes of all their beauty  kindly bear My fancy to those hours of finiple joy  When  on the banks of Arun  which I see Make its irriguous course thro  yonder meads  I played  unconscious then of future ill   There  where  from hollows fringed with yellow broom  The birch with filver rind  and fairy leaf  Aslant the low stream trembles  I have stood  And meditated how to venture best Into the shallow current  to procure The willow herb of glowing purple spikes    Or flags  whose sword like leaves concealed the tide  startling the timid reed bird from her nest  As with aquatic flowers I wove the wreath  such as  colle ted by the shepherd girls  Deck in the villages the turfy shrine  And mark the arrival of propitious May   How little dreamed I then the time would come  When the bright sun of that delicious month should  from disturb d and artificial sleep  Awaken me to never ending toil  To terror and to tears  Attempting still  With feeble hands and cold desponding heart  To save my children from the overwhelming wrongs  That have for ten long years been heaped on me    The fearful spectres of chicane and fraud Have  Proteus like  still changed their hideous forms  As the Law lent its plausible disguise   Pursuing my faint steps   and I have seen Friendships sweet bonds  which were so early formed   And once I fondly thought of amaranth Inwove with filver seven times tried  give way  And sail  as these green fan like leaves of fern Will wither at the touch of Autumn frost  Yet there are thos  whose patient pity still Hears my long murmurs  who  unwearied  try With lenient hands to bind up every wound My wearied spirit feels  and bid me go  Right onward  a calm votary of the Nymph  Who  from her adamantine rock  points Out To conscious reëtitude the rugged path  That leads at length to Peace l Ah  yes  my friends Peace will at last be mine  for in the Grave Is Peace and pass a few short years  perchance A few short months  and all the various pain I now endure shall be forgotten there  And no memorial shall remain of me  save in your bosoms  while even your regret shall lose its poignancy  as ye reflect What complicated woes that grave conceals | But  if the little praise  that may await The Mother efforts  should provoke the spleen Of Priest or Levite  and they then arraign The dust that cannot hear them  be it yours To vindicate my humb  fame  to say  That  not in selfish sufferings absorbed      I gave to misery all I had  my tears    And if  where regulated sančtity Pours her long orisons to Heaven  my voice Was seldom heard  that yet my prayer was made To him who hears even silence  not in domes Of human archite ture  filled with crowds  But on these hills  where boundless  yet distinét  Even as a map  beneath are spread the fields His bounty cloaths  divided here by woods And there by commons rude  or winding brooks  While I might breathe the air perfumed with flowers  Or the fresh odours of the mountain turf  And gaze on clouds above me  as they sailed Majestic  or remark the reddening north  When bickering arrows of electric fire Flash on the evening sky I made my prayer In unison with murmuring waves that now swell with dark tempests  now are mild and blue  As the bright arch above  for all to me Declare omniscient goodness  nor need I Declamatory essays to incite My wonder or my praise  when every leaf That spring unfolds  and every fimple bud  More forcibly impresses on my heart His power and wisdom Ah  while I adore That goodness  which designed to all that lives  some taste of happiness  my soul is pained By the variety of woes that Man For Man creates his blessings often turned To plagues and curses  saint like Piety  Misled by superstition  has destroyed More than Ambition  and the sacred flame Of Liberty becomes a raging fire  When Licence and Confusion bid it blaze  From thy high throne  above yon radiant stars  o Power Omnipotent  with mercy view This suffering globe  and cause thy creatures cease  With savage fangs  to tear her bleeding breast  Restrain that rage for power  that bids a Man  Himself a worm  desire unbounded rule Over beings like himself  Teach the hard hearts Of rulers  that the poorest hind  who dies For their unrighteous quarrels  in thy fight Is equal to the imperious Lord  that leads His disciplined destroyers to the field  May lovely Freedom  in her genuine charms  Aided by stern but equal Justice  drive From the ensanguined earth the hell born fiends Of Pride  Oppression  Avarice  and Revenge  That ruin what thy mercy made so fair  Then shall these ill starred wanderers  whose sad fate These desultory lines lament  regain Their native country   private vengeance then To public virtue yield  and the fierce feuds  That long have torn their desolated land  May  even as storms  that agitate the air  Drive noxious vapours from the blighted earth  serve  all tremendous as they are  to fix The reign of Reason  Liberty  and Peace
