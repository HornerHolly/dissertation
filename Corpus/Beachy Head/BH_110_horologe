 For her who owns this splendid toy  Where use with elegance unites  Still may its index point to joy  And moments wing with new delights  Sweet may resound each silver bell    And never quick returning chime  Seem in reproving notes to tell  1 Of hours mispent  and murder time  ho  Fortune  Emily  deny To us these splendid works of art  The woods  the lawns  the heaths supply Le ons from Nature to the heart  In every copse  and shelter dell  Unveil to the observant eye  Are faithful monitors  who tell How pa  the hours and seasons by  The green robed children of the Spring Will mark the periods as they pa   Mingle with leaves Time  feather wing  And bind with flowers his silent gla   Mark where transparent waters glide  Soft flowing er their tranquil bed  There  cradled on the dimpling tide  Nymph√¶a rests her lovely head  But conscious of the earliest beam  She rises from her humid rest  And sees reflected in the stream The virgin whitene  of her breast  Till the bright daystar to the west Declines  in Ocean  surge to lave  Then folded in her modest vest  She slumbers on the rocking wave   See Hieracium  various tribe  Of plumy seed and radiate flowers  The course of Time their blooms describe  And wake or sleep appointed hours  Broad er its imbricated cup The Goatsbeard spreads its golden rays  But shuts its cautious petals up  Retreating from the noon tide blaze  Pale as a pensive cloister nun The Bethlem star  her face unveils  When er the mountain peers the Sun  But shades it from the vesper gales   Among the loose and arid sands The humble Arenaria creeps   Slowly the purple star expands  But soon within its calyx sleeps  And those small bells so lightly ray With young Aurora  rosy hue  Are to the noon tide Sun display  But shut their plaits against the dew  On upland slopes the shepherds mark The hour  when as the dial true  Cichorium to the towering Lark  Lifts her soft eyes  serenely blue  And thou   Wee crimson tipped flower   Gatherest thy fringed mantle round Thy bosom  at the closing hour  When night drops bathe the turfy ground  Unlike Silene  who declines The garish noontide  blazing light   But when the evening crescent shines Gives all her sweetne  to the night  Thus in each flower and simple bell  That in our path untrodden lie  Are sweet remembrancers who tell How fast the winged moments fly  Time will steal on with ceasele  pace  Yet lose we not the fleeting hours  Who still their fairy footsteps trace  As light they dance among the flowers
