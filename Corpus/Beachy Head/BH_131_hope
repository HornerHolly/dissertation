  Just like Hope is yonder bow  That from the center bends so low  Where bright prismatic colours shew How gems of heavenly radiance glow  Just like Hope  Yet if  to the illusion new  The pilgrim should the arch pursue  Farther and farther from his view  It flies  then melts in chilling dew  Just like Hope  Ye fade  ethereal hues   for ever  While  cold Reason  thy endeavour Sooths not that sad heart  which never Glows with Hope
