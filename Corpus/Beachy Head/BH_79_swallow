 The gorse is yellow on the heath  The banks with speedwell flowers are gay  The oaks are budding  and beneath  The hawthorn soon will bear the wreath  The silver wreath of May  The welcome guest of settled Spring  The Swallow too is come at last  Just at sun set  when thrushes sing  I saw her dash with rapid wing  And hail her as she pa   Come  summer visitant  attach To my reed roof your nest of clay  And let my ear your music catch Low twittering underneath the thatch At the gray dawn of day  As fables tell  an Indian Sage  The Hindostani woods among  Could in his desert hermitage  As if  twere mark in written page  Translate the wild bird  song  I wish I did his power po e   That I might learn  fleet bird  from thee  What our vain systems only gue   And know from what wide wilderne  You came acro  the sea   I would a little while restrain Your rapid wing  that I might hear Whether on clouds that bring the rain  You sail above the western main  The wind your charioteer  In Afric  does the sultry gale Thro  spicy bower  and palmy grove  Bear the repeated Cuckoo  tale  Dwells there a time  the wandering Rail Or the itinerant Dove  Were you in Asia   relate  If there your fabled sister  woes She seem in sorrow to narrate  Or sings she but to celebrate Her nuptials with the rose   i I would enquire how journeying long  The vast and pathle  ocean er  You ply again those pinions strong  And come to build anew among The scenes you left before     But if  as colder breezes blow  Prophetic of the waning year  You hide  tho  none know when or how  In the cliff   excavated brow  And linger torpid here  Thus lost to life  what favouring dream Bids you to happier hours awake  And tells  that dancing in the beam  The light gnat hovers er the stream  The May fly on the lake  Or if  by instinct taught to know Approaching dearth of insect food  To isles and willowy aits you go  And crouding on the pliant bough  Sink in the dimpling flood   How learn ye  while the cold waves boom Your deep and ouzy couch above  The time when flowers of promise bloom  And call you from your transient tomb  To light  and life  and love  Alas  how little can be known  Her sacred veil where Nature draws  Let baffled Science humbly own  Her mysteries understood alone  By Him who gives her laws
