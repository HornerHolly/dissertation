 Like a shipwreck'd Sailor tost
    By rough waves on a perilous coast,
    Lies the Babe, in helplessness
    And in tenderest nakedness,
    Flung by labouring nature forth                                    
    Upon the mercies of the earth.
    Can its eyes beseech?--no more
    Than the hands are free to implore:
    Voice but serves for one brief cry;
    Plaint was it? or prophecy                                        
    Of sorrow that will surely come?
    Omen of man's grievous doom!

      But, O Mother! by the close
    Duly granted to thy throes;
    By the silent thanks, now tending                                 
    Incense-like to Heaven, descending
    Now to mingle and to move
    With the gush of earthly love,
    As a debt to that frail Creature,
    Instrument of struggling Nature                                   
    For the blissful calm, the peace
    Known but to this _one_ release--
    Can the pitying spirit doubt
    That for human-kind springs out
    From the penalty a sense                                          
    Of more than mortal recompense?

      As a floating summer cloud,
    Though of gorgeous drapery proud,
    To the sun-burnt traveller,
    Or the stooping labourer,                                         
    Oft-times makes its bounty known
    By its shadow round him thrown;
    So, by chequerings of sad cheer,
    Heavenly Guardians, brooding near,
    Of their presence tell--too bright                                
    Haply for corporeal sight!
    Ministers of grace divine
    Feelingly their brows incline
    O'er this seeming Castaway
    Breathing, in the light of day,                                   
    Something like the faintest breath
    That has power to baffle death--
    Beautiful, while very weakness
    Captivates like passive meekness.

      And, sweet Mother! under warrant                                
    Of the universal Parent,
    Who repays in season due
    Them who have, like thee, been true
    To the filial chain let down
    From his everlasting throne,
    Angels hovering round thy couch,
    With their softest whispers vouch,
    That--whatever griefs may fret,
    Cares entangle, sins beset,
    This thy First-born, and with tears                               
    Stain her cheek in future years--
    Heavenly succour, not denied
    To the babe, whate'er betide,
    Will to the woman be supplied!

      Mother! blest be thy calm ease;                                 
    Blest the starry promises,--
    And the firmament benign
    Hallowed be it, where they shine!
    Yes, for them whose souls have scope
    Ample for a wing√®d hope,                                          
    And can earthward bend an ear
    For needful listening, pledge is here,
    That, if thy new-born Charge shall tread
    In thy footsteps, and be led
    By that other Guide, whose light                                  
    Of manly virtues, mildly bright,
    Gave him first the wished-for part
    In thy gentle virgin heart;
    Then, amid the storms of life
    Presignified by that dread strife                                 
    Whence ye have escaped together,
    She may look for serene weather;
    In all trials sure to find
    Comfort for a faithful mind;
    Kindlier issues, holier rest,                                     
    Than even now await her prest,
    Conscious Nursling, to thy breast!
