A bright-haired company of youthful slaves,
    Beautiful strangers, stand within the pale
    Of a sad market, ranged for public sale,
    Where Tiber's stream the immortal City laves:
    ANGLI by name; and not an ANGEL waves                              
    His wing who could seem lovelier to man's eye
    Than they appear to holy Gregory;
    Who, having learnt that name, salvation craves
    For Them, and for their Land. The earnest Sire,
    His questions urging, feels, in slender ties                      
    Of chiming sound, commanding sympathies;
    DE-IRIANS--he would save them from God's IRE;
    Subjects of Saxon Ã†LLA--they shall sing
    Glad HALLE-lujahs to the eternal King!
