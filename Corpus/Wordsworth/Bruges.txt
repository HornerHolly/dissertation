  Bruges I saw attired with golden light
    Streamed from the west as with a robe of power
    The splendour fled and now the sunless hour,
    That, slowly making way for peaceful night,
    Best suits with fallen grandeur, to my sight                   
    Offers the beauty, the magnificence,
    And sober graces left her for defence
    Against the injuries of time, the spite
    Of fortune, and the desolating storms
    Of future war. Advance not spare to hide,                    
    O gentle Power of darkness these mild hues;
    Obscure not yet these silent avenues
    Of stateliest architecture, where the Forms
    Of nun-like females, with soft motion, glide!
