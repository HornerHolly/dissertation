 Uttered by whom, or how inspired designed
    For what strange service, does this concert reach
    Our ears, and near the dwellings of mankind!
    Mid fields familiarized to human speech?--
    No Mermaids warble to allay the wind                          
    Driving some vessel toward a dangerous beach--
    More thrilling melodies; Witch answering Witch,
    To chaunt a love-spell, never intertwined
    Notes shrill and wild with art more musical:
    Alas! that from the lips of abject Want                       
    Or Idleness in tatters mendicant
    The strain should flow-free Fancy to enthral,
    And with regret and useless pity haunt
    This bold, this bright, this sky-born, WATERFALL!
