The lovely Nun (submissive, but more meek
    Through saintly habit than from effort due
    To unrelenting mandates that pursue
    With equal wrath the steps of strong and weak)
    Goes forth--unveiling timidly a cheek   
    Suffused with blushes of celestial hue,
    While through the Convent's gate to open view
    Softly she glides, another home to seek.
    Not Iris, issuing from her cloudy shrine,
    An Apparition more divinely bright!                               
    Not more attractive to the dazzled sight
    Those watery glories, on the stormy brine
    Poured forth, while summer suns at distance shine,
    And the green vales lie hushed in sober light!
