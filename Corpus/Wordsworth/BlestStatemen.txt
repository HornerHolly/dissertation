  Blest Statesman He, whose Mind unselfish will
    Leaves him at ease among grand thoughts: whose eye
    Sees that, apart from magnanimity,
    Wisdom exists not; nor the humbler skill
    Of Prudence, disentangling good and ill                            
    With patient care. What tho assaults run high,
    They daunt not him who holds his ministry,
    Resolute, at all hazards, to fulfil
    Its duties prompt to move, but firm to wait,--
    Knowing, things rashly sought are rarely found;                   
    That, for the functions of an ancient State--
    Strong by her charters, free because imbound,
    Servant of Providence, not slave of Fate--
    Perilous is sweeping change, all chance unsound.
