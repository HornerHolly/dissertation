  From the Pier head, musing, and with increase
    Of wonder, I have watched this sea-side Town,
    Under the white cliff battlemented crown,
    Hushed to a depth of more than Sabbath peace:
    The streets and quays are thronged, but why disown             
    Their natural utterance: whence this strange release
    From social noise silence elsewhere unknown
    A Spirit whispered, Let all wonder cease
    Ocean o'erpowering murmurs have set free
    Thy sense from pressure of life common din;                 
    As the dread Voice that speaks from out the sea
    Of God eternal Word, the Voice of Time
    Doth deaden, shocks of tumult, shrieks of crime,
    The shouts of folly, and the groans of sin."
