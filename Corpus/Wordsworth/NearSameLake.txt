  For action born, existing to be tried,
    Powers manifold we have that intervene
    To stir the heart that would too closely screen
    Her peace from images to pain allied.
    What wonder if at midnight, by the side                            
    Of Sanguinetto or broad Thrasymene,
    The clang of arms is heard, and phantoms glide,
    Unhappy ghosts in troops by moonlight seen;
    And singly thine, O vanquished Chief! whose corse,
    Unburied, lay hid under heaps of slain:                           
    But who is He?--the Conqueror. Would he force
    His way to Rome? Ah, no,--round hill and plain
    Wandering, he haunts, at fancyâ€™s strong command,
    This spot--his shadowy death-cup in his hand.
