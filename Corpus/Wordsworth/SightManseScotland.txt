Say, ye far-travelled clouds, far-seeing hills--
    Among the happiest-looking homes of men
    Scatter'd all Britain over, through deep glen,
    On airy upland, and by forest rills,
    And o'er wide plains cheered by the lark that trills               
    His sky-born warblings--does aught meet your ken
    More fit to animate the Poet's pen,
    Aught that more surely by its aspect fills
    Pure minds with sinless envy, than the Abode
    Of the good Priest: who, faithful through all hours               
    To his high charge, and truly serving God,
    Has yet a heart and hand for trees and flowers,
    Enjoys the walks his predecessors trod,
    Nor covets lineal rights in lands and towers.
