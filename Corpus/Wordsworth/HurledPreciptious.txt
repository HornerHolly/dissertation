 Not hurled precipitous from steep to steep;
    Lingering no more 'mid flower-enamelled lands
    And blooming thickets; nor by rocky bands
    Held; but in radiant progress toward the Deep
    Where mightiest rivers into powerless sleep                    
    Sink, and forget their nature--_now_ expands
    Majestic Duddon, over smooth flat sands
    Gliding in silence with unfettered sweep!
    Beneath an ampler sky a region wide
    Is opened round him:--hamlets, towers, and towns,
    And blue-topped hills, behold him from afar;                  
    In stately mien to sovereign Thames allied
    Spreading his bosom under Kentish downs,
    With commerce freighted, or triumphant war.
