How art thou named? In search of what strange land,
    From what huge height, descending? Can such force
    Of waters issue from a British source,
    Or hath not Pindus fed thee, where the band
    Of Patriots scoop their freedom out, with hand                     
    Desperate as thine? Or come the incessant shocks
    From that young Stream, that smites the throbbing rocks
    Of Viamala? There I seem to stand,
    As in life's morn; permitted to behold,
    From the dread chasm, woods climbing above woods,                 
    In pomp that fades not; everlasting snows;
    And skies that ne'er relinquish their repose;
    Such power possess the family of floods
    Over the minds of Poets, young or old!
