  Furl we the sails, and pass with tardy oars
    Through these bright regions, casting many a glance
    Upon the dream-like issues--the romance
    Of many-coloured life that Fortune pours
    Round the Crusaders, till on distant shores                        
    Their labours end; or they return to lie,
    The vow performed, in cross-legged effigy,
    Devoutly stretched upon their chancel floors.
    Am I deceived? Or is their requiem chanted
    By voices never mute when Heaven unties                           
    Her inmost, softest, tenderest harmonies;
    Requiem which Earth takes up with voice undaunted,
    When she would tell how Brave, and Good, and Wise,
    For their high guerdon not in vain have panted!
