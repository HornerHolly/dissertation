 Ye shadowy Beings, that have rights and claims
    In every cell of Fingal's mystic Grot,
    Where are ye? Driven or venturing to the spot,
    Our fathers glimpses caught of your thin Frames,
    And, by your mien and bearing, knew your names;                    
    And they could hear _his_ ghostly song who trod
    Earth, till the flesh lay on him like a load,
    While he struck his desolate harp without hopes or aims.
    Vanished ye are, but subject to recal;
    Why keep _we_ else the instincts whose dread law                  
    Ruled here of yore, till what men felt they saw,
    Not by black arts but magic natural!
    If eyes be still sworn vassals of belief,
    Yon light shapes forth a Bard, that shade a Chief.
