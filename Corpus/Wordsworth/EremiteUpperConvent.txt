What aim had they, the Pair of Monks, in size
    Enormous, dragged, while side by side they sate,
    By panting steers up to this convent gate?
    How, with empurpled cheeks and pampered eyes,
    Dare they confront the lean austerities                            
    Of Brethren, who, here fixed, on Jesu wait
    In sackcloth, and Godâ€™s anger deprecate
    Through all that humbles flesh and mortifies?
    Strange contrast!--verily the world of dreams,
    Where mingle, as for mockery combined,                            
    Things in their very essences at strife,
    Shows not a sight incongruous as the extremes
    That everywhere, before the thoughtful mind,
    Meet on the solid ground of waking life.
