 Rise!--they _have_ risen: of brave Aneurin ask
    How they have scourged old foes, perfidious friends:
    The Spirit of Caractacus descends
    Upon the Patriots, animates their task;
    Amazement runs before the towering casque                              
    Of Arthur, bearing through the stormy field
    The Virgin sculptured on his Christian shield:--
    Stretched in the sunny light of victory bask
    The Host that followed Urien as he strode
    O'er heaps of slain;--from Cambrian wood and moss                     
    Druids descend, auxiliars of the Cross;
    Bards, nursed on blue Plinlimmon's still abode,
    Rush on the fight, to harps preferring swords,
    And everlasting deeds to burning words!
