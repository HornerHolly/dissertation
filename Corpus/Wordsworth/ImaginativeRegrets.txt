 Deep is the lamentation! Not alone
    From Sages justly honoured by mankind;
    But from the ghostly tenants of the wind,
    Demons and Spirits, many a dolorous groan
    Issues for that dominion overthrown:                               
    Proud Tiber grieves, and far-off Ganges, blind
    As his own worshippers: and Nile, reclined
    Upon his monstrous urn, the farewell moan
    Renews. Through every forest, cave, and den,
    Where frauds were hatched of old, hath sorrow past--
    Hangs o'er the Arabian Prophet's native Waste,
    Where once his airy helpers schemed and planned
    'Mid spectral lakes bemocking thirsty men,
    And stalking pillars built of fiery sand.
