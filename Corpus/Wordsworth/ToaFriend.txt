 Pastor and Patriot!--at whose bidding rise
    These modest walls, amid a flock that need,
    For one who comes to watch them and to feed,
    A fixed Abode--keep down presageful sighs.
    Threats, which the unthinking only can despise,                    
    Perplex the Church; but be thou firm,--be true
    To thy first hope, and this good work pursue,
    Poor as thou art. A welcome sacrifice
    Dost Thou prepare, whose sign will be the smoke
    Of thy new hearth; and sooner shall its wreaths,                  
    Mounting while earth her morning incense breathes,
    From wandering fiends of air receive a yoke,
    And straightway cease to aspire, than God disdain
    This humble tribute as ill-timed or vain.
