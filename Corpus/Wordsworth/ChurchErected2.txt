 Mine ear has rung, my spirit sunk subdued,
    Sharing the strong emotion of the crowd,
    When each pale brow to dread hosannas bowed
    While clouds of incense mounting veiled the rood,
    That glimmered like a pine-tree dimly viewed                       
    Through Alpine vapours. Such appalling rite
    Our Church prepares not, trusting to the might
    Of simple truth with grace divine imbued;
    Yet will we not conceal the precious Cross,
    Like men ashamed: the Sun with his first smile
    Shall greet that symbol crowning the low Pile:                    
    And the fresh air of incense-breathing morn
    Shall wooingly embrace it; and green moss
    Creep round its arms through centuries unborn.
