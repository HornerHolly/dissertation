The massy Ways, carried across these heights
    By Roman perseverance, are destroyed,
    Or hidden under ground, like sleeping worms.
    How venture then to hope that Time will spare
    This humble Walk? Yet on the mountain's side                       
    A POET'S hand first shaped it; and the steps
    Of that same Bard--repeated to and fro
    At morn, at noon, and under moonlight skies
    Through the vicissitudes of many a year--
    Forbade the weeds to creep o'er its grey line.                    
    No longer, scattering to the heedless winds
    The vocal raptures of fresh poesy,
    Shall he frequent these precincts; locked no more
    In earnest converse with beloved Friends,
    Here will he gather stores of ready bliss,                        
    As from the beds and borders of a garden
    Choice flowers are gathered! But, if Power may spring
    Out of a farewell yearning--favoured more
    Than kindred wishes mated suitably
    With vain regrets--the Exile would consign                        
    This Walk, his loved possession, to the care
    Of those pure Minds that reverence the Muse.
