 "To every Form of being is assigned,"
    Thus calmly spake the venerable Sage,
    "An _active_ Principle:--howe'er removed
    From sense and observation, it subsists
    In all things, in all natures; in the stars                    
    Of azure heaven, the unenduring clouds,
    In flower and tree, in every pebbly stone
    That paves the brooks, the stationary rocks,
    The moving waters, and the invisible air.
    Whate'er exists hath properties that spread                   
    Beyond itself, communicating good,
    A simple blessing, or with evil mixed;
    Spirit that knows no insulated spot,
    No chasm, no solitude; from link to link
    It circulates, the Soul of all the worlds
    This is the freedom of the universe;
    Unfolded still the more, more visible,
    The more we know; and yet is reverenced least,
    And least respected in the human Mind,
    Its most apparent home. The food of hope                      
    Is meditated action; robbed of this
    Her sole support, she languishes and dies.
    We perish also; for we live by hope
    And by desire; we see by the glad light
    And breathe the sweet air of futurity;                        
    And so we live, or else we have no life.
    To-morrow--nay perchance this very hour
    (For every moment hath its own to-morrow!)
    Those blooming Boys, whose hearts are almost sick
    With present triumph, will be sure to find                    
    A field before them freshened with the dew
    Of other expectations;--in which course
    Their happy year spins round. The youth obeys
    A like glad impulse; and so moves the man
    'Mid all his apprehensions, cares, and fears,--               
    Or so he ought to move. Ah! why in age
    Do we revert so fondly to the walks
    Of childhood--but that there the Soul discerns
    The dear memorial footsteps unimpaired
    Of her own native vigour; thence can hear
    Reverberations; and a choral song,
    Commingling with the incense that ascends,
    Undaunted, toward the imperishable heavens,
    From her own lonely altar?
                                "Do not think
    That good and wise ever will be allowed,
    Though strength decay, to breathe in such estate
    As shall divide them wholly from the stir
    Of hopeful nature. Rightly it is said
    That Man descends into the Vale of years;
    Yet have I thought that we might also speak,                  
    And not presumptuously, I trust, of Age,
    As of a final Eminence; though bare
    In aspect and forbidding, yet a point
    On which 'tis not impossible to sit
    In awful sovereignty; a place of power,                       
    A throne, that may be likened unto his,
    Who, in some placid day of summer, looks
    Down from a mountain-top,--say one of those
    High peaks, that bound the vale where now we are.
    Faint, and diminished to the gazing eye,                     
    Forest and field, and hill and dale appear,
    With all the shapes over their surface spread:
    But, while the gross and visible frame of things
    Relinquishes its hold upon the sense,
    Yea almost on the Mind herself, and seems                
    All unsubstantialized,--how loud the voice
    Of waters, with invigorated peal
    From the full river in the vale below,
    Ascending! For on that superior height
    Who sits, is disencumbered from the press                     
    Of near obstructions, and is privileged
    To breathe in solitude, above the host
    Of ever-humming insects, 'mid thin air
    That suits not them. The murmur of the leaves
    Many and idle, visits not his ear:                       
    This he is freed from, and from thousand notes
    (Not less unceasing, not less vain than these,)
    By which the finer passages of sense
    Are occupied; and the Soul, that would incline
    To listen, is prevented or deterred.                          

      "And may it not be hoped, that, placed by age
    In like removal, tranquil though severe,
    We are not so removed for utter loss;
    But for some favour, suited to our need?
    What more than that the severing should confer
    Fresh power to commune with the invisible world,
    And hear the mighty stream of tendency
    Uttering, for elevation of our thought,
    A clear sonorous voice, inaudible
    To the vast multitude; whose doom it is                       
    To run the giddy round of vain delight,
    Or fret and labour on the Plain below.

      "But, if to such sublime ascent the hopes
    Of Man may rise, as to a welcome close
    And termination of his mortal course;                         
    Them only can such hope inspire whose minds
    Have not been starved by absolute neglect;
    Nor bodies crushed by unremitting toil;
    To whom kind Nature, therefore, may afford
    Proof of the sacred love she bears for all;                  
    Whose birthright Reason, therefore, may ensure.
    For me, consulting what I feel within
    In times when most existence with herself
    Is satisfied, I cannot but believe,
    That, far as kindly Nature hath free scope                   
    And Reason's sway predominates; even so far,
    Country, society, and time itself,
    That saps the individual's bodily frame,
    And lays the generations low in dust,
    Do, by the almighty Ruler's grace, partake                   
    Of one maternal spirit, bringing forth
    And cherishing with ever-constant love,
    That tires not, nor betrays. Our life is turned
    Out of her course, wherever man is made
    An offering, or a sacrifice, a tool                          
    Or implement, a passive thing employed
    As a brute mean, without acknowledgment
    Of common right or interest in the end;
    Used or abused, as selfishness may prompt.
    Say, what can follow for a rational soul                     
    Perverted thus, but weakness in all good,
    And strength in evil? Hence an after-call
    For chastisement, and custody, and bonds,
    And oft-times Death, avenger of the past,
    And the sole guardian in whose hands we dare                 
    Entrust the future.--Not for these sad issues
    Was Man created; but to obey the law
    Of life, and hope, and action. And 'tis known
    That when we stand upon our native soil,
    Unelbowed by such objects as oppress                         
    Our active powers, those powers themselves become
    Strong to subvert our noxious qualities:
    They sweep distemper from the busy day,
    And make the chalice of the big round year
    Run o'er with gladness; whence the Being moves          
    In beauty through the world; and all who see
    Bless him, rejoicing in his neighbourhood."

      "Then," said the Solitary, "by what force
    Of language shall a feeling heart express
    Her sorrow for that multitude in whom                        
    We look for health from seeds that have been sown
    In sickness, and for increase in a power
    That works but by extinction? On themselves
    They cannot lean, nor turn to their own hearts
    To know what they must do; their wisdom is                   
    To look into the eyes of others, thence
    To be instructed what they must avoid:
    Or rather, let us say, how least observed,
    How with most quiet and most silent death,
    With the least taint and injury to the air                   
    The oppressor breathes, their human form divine,
    And their immortal soul, may waste away."

      The Sage rejoined, "I thank you--you have spared
    My voice the utterance of a keen regret,
    A wide compassion which with you I share.                    
    When, heretofore, I placed before your sight
    A Little-one, subjected to the arts
    Of modern ingenuity, and made
    The senseless member of a vast machine,
    Serving as doth a spindle or a wheel;                        
    Think not, that, pitying him, I could forget
    The rustic Boy, who walks the fields, untaught;
    The slave of ignorance, and oft of want,
    And miserable hunger. Much, too much,
    Of this unhappy lot, in early youth                          
    We both have witnessed, lot which I myself
    Shared, though in mild and merciful degree:
    Yet was the mind to hinderances exposed,
    Through which I struggled, not without distress
    And sometimes injury, like a lamb enthralled            
    'Mid thorns and brambles; or a bird that breaks
    Through a strong net, and mounts upon the wind,
    Though with her plumes impaired. If they, whose souls
    Should open while they range the richer fields
    Of merry England, are obstructed less,                    
    By indigence, their ignorance is not less,
    Nor less to be deplored. For who can doubt
    That tens of thousands at this day exist
    Such as the boy you painted, lineal heirs
    Of those who once were vassals of her soil,                 
    Following its fortunes like the beasts or trees
    Which it sustained. But no one takes delight
    In this oppression; none are proud of it;
    It bears no sounding name, nor ever bore;
    A standing grievance, an indigenous vice                     
    Of every country under heaven. My thoughts
    Were turned to evils that are new and chosen,
    A bondage lurking under shape of good,--
    Arts, in themselves beneficent and kind,
    But all too fondly followed and too far;--                   
    To victims, which the merciful can see
    Nor think that they are victims--turned to wrongs,
    By women, who have children of their own,
    Beheld without compassion, yea with praise!
    I spake of mischief by the wise diffused
    With gladness, thinking that the more it spreads
    The healthier, the securer, we become;
    Delusion which a moment may destroy!
    Lastly I mourned for those whom I had seen
    Corrupted and cast down, on favoured ground,                 
    Where circumstance and nature had combined
    To shelter innocence, and cherish love;
    Who, but for this intrusion, would have lived,
    Possessed of health, and strength, and peace of mind;
    Thus would have lived, or never have been born!              

      "Alas! what differs more than man from man!
    And whence that difference? Whence but from himself?
    For see the universal Race endowed
    With the same upright form!--The sun is fixed,
    And the infinite magnificence of heaven                      
    Fixed, within reach of every human eye;
    The sleepless ocean murmurs for all ears;
    The vernal field infuses fresh delight
    Into all hearts. Throughout the world of sense,
    Even as an object is sublime or fair,                     
    That object is laid open to the view
    Without reserve or veil; and as a power
    Is salutary, or an influence sweet,
    Are each and all enabled to perceive
    That power, that influence, by impartial law.              
    Gifts nobler are vouchsafed alike to all;
    Reason, and, with that reason, smiles and tears;
    Imagination, freedom in the will;
    Conscience to guide and check; and death to be
    Foretasted, immortality conceived                            
    By all,--a blissful immortality,
    To them whose holiness on earth shall make
    The Spirit capable of heaven, assured.
    Strange, then, nor less than monstrous, might be deemed
    The failure, if the Almighty, to this point                  
    Liberal and undistinguishing, should hide
    The excellence of moral qualities
    From common understanding; leaving truth
    And virtue, difficult, abstruse, and dark;
    Hard to be won, and only by a few;                           
    Strange, should He deal herein with nice respects,
    And frustrate all the rest! Believe it not:
    The primal duties shine aloft--like stars;
    The charities that soothe, and heal, and bless,
    Are scattered at the feet of Man--like flowers.              
    The generous inclination, the just rule,
    Kind wishes, and good actions, and pure thoughts--
    No mystery is here! Here is no boon
    For high--yet not for low; for proudly graced--
    Yet not for meek of heart. The smoke ascends            
    To heaven as lightly from the cottage-hearth
    As from the haughtiest palace. He, whose soul
    Ponders this true equality, may walk
    The fields of earth with gratitude and hope;
    Yet, in that meditation, will he find                        
    Motive to sadder grief, as we have found;
    Lamenting ancient virtues overthrown,
    And for the injustice grieving, that hath made
    So wide a difference between man and man.

      "Then let us rather fix our gladdened thoughts
    Upon the brighter scene. How blest that pair
    Of blooming Boys (whom we beheld even now)
    Blest in their several and their common lot!
    A few short hours of each returning day
    The thriving prisoners of their village-school:              
    And thence let loose, to seek their pleasant homes
    Or range the grassy lawn in vacancy;
    To breathe and to be happy, run and shout
    Idle,--but no delay, no harm, no loss;
    For every genial power of heaven and earth,            
    Through all the seasons of the changeful year,
    Obsequiously doth take upon herself
    To labour for them; bringing each in turn
    The tribute of enjoyment, knowledge, health,
    Beauty, or strength! Such privilege is theirs,             
    Granted alike in the outset of their course
    To both; and, if that partnership must cease,
    I grieve not," to the Pastor here he turned,
    "Much as I glory in that child of yours,
    Repine not for his cottage-comrade, whom                    
    Belike no higher destiny awaits
    Than the old hereditary wish fulfilled;
    The wish for liberty to live--content
    With what Heaven grants, and die--in peace of mind,
    Within the bosom of his native vale.                        
    At least, whatever fate the noon of life
    Reserves for either, sure it is that both
    Have been permitted to enjoy the dawn;
    Whether regarded as a jocund time,
    That in itself may terminate, or lead                        
    In course of nature to a sober eve.
    Both have been fairly dealt with; looking back
    They will allow that justice has in them
    Been shown, alike to body and to mind."

      He paused, as if revolving in his soul                     
    Some weighty matter; then, with fervent voice
    And an impassioned majesty, exclaimed--

      "O for the coming of that glorious time
    When, prizing knowledge as her noblest wealth
    And best protection, this imperial Realm                     
    While she exacts allegiance, shall admit
    An obligation, on her part, to _teach_
    Them who are born to serve her and obey;
    Binding herself by statute to secure
    For all the children whom her soil maintains               
    The rudiments of letters, and inform
    The mind with moral and religious truth,
    Both understood and practised,--so that none,
    However destitute, be left to droop
    By timely culture unsustained; or run                        
    Into a wild disorder; or be forced
    To drudge through a weary life without the help
    Of intellectual implements and tools;
    A savage horde among the civilised,
    A servile band among the lordly free!                        
    This sacred right, the lisping babe proclaims
    To be inherent in him, by Heaven's will,
    For the protection of his innocence;
    And the rude boy--who, having overpast
    The sinless age, by conscience is enrolled,                  
    Yet mutinously knits his angry brow,
    And lifts his wilful hand on mischief bent,
    Or turns the godlike[846] faculty of speech
    To impious use--by process indirect
    Declares his due, while he makes known his need.             
    --This sacred right is fruitlessly announced,
    This universal plea in vain addressed,
    To eyes and ears of parents who themselves
    Did, in the time of their necessity,
    Urge it in vain; and, therefore, like a prayer               
    That from the humblest floor ascends to heaven,
    It mounts to reach the State's parental ear;
    Who, if indeed she own a mother's heart,
    And be not most unfeelingly devoid
    Of gratitude to Providence, will grant                       
    The unquestionable good--which, England, safe
    From interference of external force,
    May grant at leisure; without risk incurred
    That what in wisdom for herself she doth,
    Others shall e'er be able to undo.                           

      "Look! and behold, from Calpe's sunburnt cliffs
    To the flat margin of the Baltic sea,
    Long-reverenced titles cast away as weeds;
    Laws overturned; and territory split,
    Like fields of ice rent by the polar wind,                   
    And forced to join in less obnoxious shapes
    Which,[847] ere they gain consistence, by a gust
    Of the same breath are shattered and destroyed.
    Meantime the sovereignty of these fair Isles
    Remains entire and indivisible:                              
    And, if that ignorance were removed, which breeds[
    Within the compass of their several shores
    Dark discontent, or loud commotion, each
    Might still preserve the beautiful repose
    Of heavenly bodies shining in their spheres.                 
    --The discipline of slavery is unknown
    Among us,--hence the more do we require
    The discipline of virtue; order else
    Cannot subsist, nor confidence, nor peace.
    Thus, duties rising out of good possest                      
    And prudent caution needful to avert
    Impending evil, equally require
    That the whole people should be taught and trained.
    So shall licentiousness and black resolve
    Be rooted out, and virtuous habits take                      
    Their place; and genuine piety descend,
    Like an inheritance, from age to age.

      "With such foundations laid, avaunt the fear
    Of numbers crowded on their native soil,
    To the prevention of all healthful growth                    
    Through mutual injury! Rather in the law
    Of increase and the mandate from above
    Rejoice!--and ye have special cause for joy.
    --For, as the element of air affords
    An easy passage to the industrious bees                      
    Fraught with their burthens; and a way as smooth
    For those ordained to take their sounding flight
    From the thronged hive, and settle where they list
    In fresh abodes--their labour to renew;
    So the wide waters, open to the power,                       
    The will, the instincts, and appointed needs
    Of Britain, do invite her to cast off
    Her swarms, and in succession send them forth;
    Bound to establish new communities
    On every shore whose aspect favours hope                     
    Or bold adventure; promising to skill
    And perseverance their deserved reward.

      "Yes," he continued, kindling as he spake,
    "Change wide, and deep, and silently performed,
    This Land shall witness; and as days roll on,                
    Earth's universal frame shall feel the effect;
    Even till the smallest habitable rock,
    Beaten by lonely billows, hear the songs
    Of humanised society; and bloom
    With civil arts, that shall breathe forth their fragrance,
    A grateful tribute to all-ruling Heaven.                     
    From culture, unexclusively bestowed
    On Albion's noble Race in freedom born,
    Expect these mighty issues: from the pains
    And faithful care of unambitious schools                
    Instructing simple childhood's ready ear:
    Thence look for these magnificent results!
    --Vast the circumference of hope--and ye
    Are at its centre, British Lawgivers;
    Ah! sleep not there in shame! Shall Wisdom's voice
    From out the bosom of these troubled times                   
    Repeat the dictates of her calmer mind,
    And shall the venerable halls ye fill
    Refuse to echo the sublime decree?
    Trust not to partial care a general good;                    
    Transfer not to futurity a work
    Of urgent need.--Your Country must complete
    Her glorious destiny. Begin even now,
    Now, when oppression, like the Egyptian plague
    Of darkness, stretched o'er guilty Europe, makes         
    The brightness more conspicuous that invests
    The happy Island where ye think and act;
    Now, when destruction is a prime pursuit,
    Show to the wretched nations for what end
    The powers of civil polity were given."                      

      Abruptly here, but with a graceful air,
    The Sage broke off. No sooner had he ceased
    Than, looking forth, the gentle Lady said,
    "Behold the shades of afternoon have fallen
    Upon this flowery slope; and see--beyond--                   
    The silvery lake is streaked with placid blue;
    As if preparing for the peace of evening.
    How temptingly the landscape shines! The air
    Breathes invitation; easy is the walk
    To the lake's margin, where a boat lies moored               
    Under a sheltering tree."--Upon this hint
    We rose together: all were pleased; but most
    The beauteous girl, whose cheek was flushed with joy.
    Light as a sunbeam glides along the hill
    She vanished--eager to impart the scheme                     
    To her loved brother and his shy compeer.
    --Now was there bustle in the Vicar's house
    And earnest preparation.--Forth we went,
    And down the vale along the streamlet's edge
    Pursued our way, a broken company,                           
    Mute or conversing, single or in pairs.
    Thus having reached a bridge, that overarched
    The hasty rivulet where it lay becalmed
    In a deep pool, by happy chance we saw
    A two-fold image; on a grassy bank                          
    A snow-white ram, and in the crystal flood
    Another and the same! Most beautiful,
    On the green turf, with his imperial front
    Shaggy and bold, and wreathèd horns superb,
    The breathing creature stood; as beautiful,                  
    Beneath him, shewed his shadowy counterpart.
    Each had his glowing mountains, each his sky,
    And each seemed centre of his own fair world:
    Antipodes unconscious of each other,
    Yet, in partition, with their several spheres,               
    Blended in perfect stillness, to our sight!

      "Ah! what a pity were it to disperse,
    Or to disturb, so fair a spectacle,
    And yet a breath can do it!"
                                 These few words
    The Lady whispered, while we stood and gazed                 
    Gathered together, all in still delight,
    Not without awe. Thence passing on, she said
    In like low voice to my particular ear,
    "I love to hear that eloquent old Man
    Pour forth his meditations, and descant                      
    On human life from infancy to age.
    How pure his spirit! in what vivid hues
    His mind gives back the various forms of things,
    Caught in their fairest, happiest, attitude!
    While he is speaking, I have power to see                    
    Even as he sees; but when his voice hath ceased,
    Then, with a sigh, sometimes I feel, as now,
    That combinations so serene and bright
    Cannot be lasting in a world like ours,
    Whose highest beauty, beautiful as it is,                    
    Like that reflected in yon quiet pool,
    Seems but a fleeting sun-beam's gift, whose peace
    The sufferance only of a breath of air!"

      More had she said--but sportive shouts were heard
    Sent from the jocund hearts of those two Boys,               
    Who, bearing each a basket on his arm,
    Down the green field came tripping after us.
    With caution we embarked; and now the pair
    For prouder service were addrest; but each,
    Wishful to leave an opening for my choice,                  
    Dropped the light oar his eager hand had seized.
    Thanks given for that becoming courtesy,
    Their place I took--and for a grateful office
    Pregnant with recollections of the time
    When, on thy bosom, spacious Windermere!
    A Youth, I practised this delightful art;
    Tossed on the waves alone, or 'mid a crew
    Of joyous comrades. Soon as the reedy marge
    Was cleared, I dipped, with arms accordant, oars
    Free from obstruction; and the boat advanced                 
    Through crystal water, smoothly as a hawk,
    That, disentangled from the shady boughs
    Of some thick wood, her place of covert, cleaves
    With correspondent wings the abyss of air.
    --"Observe," the Vicar said, "yon rocky isle                 
    With birch-trees fringed; my hand shall guide the helm,
    While thitherward we shape our course; or while
    We seek that other, on the western shore;
    Where the bare columns of those lofty firs,
    Supporting gracefully a massy dome                           
    Of sombre foliage, seem to imitate
    A Grecian temple rising from the Deep."

      "Turn where we may," said I, "we cannot err
    In this delicious region."--Cultured slopes,
    Wild tracts of forest-ground, and scattered groves,          
    And mountains bare, or clothed with ancient woods,
    Surrounded us; and, as we held our way
    Along the level of the glassy flood,
    They ceased not to surround us; change of place,
    From kindred features diversely combined,                    
    Producing change of beauty ever new.
    --Ah! that such beauty, varying in the light
    Of living nature, cannot be portrayed
    By words, nor by the pencil's silent skill;
    But is the property of him alone                             
    Who hath beheld it, noted it with care,
    And in his mind recorded it with love!
    Suffice it, therefore, if the rural Muse
    Vouchsafe sweet influence, while her Poet speaks
    Of trivial occupations well devised,                         
    And unsought pleasures springing up by chance;
    As if some friendly Genius had ordained
    That, as the day thus far had been enriched
    By acquisition of sincere delight,
    The same should be continued to its close.                   

      One spirit animating old and young,
    A gipsy-fire we kindled on the shore
    Of the fair Isle with birch-trees fringed--and there,
    Merrily seated in a ring, partook
    A choice repast--served by our young companions
    With rival earnestness and kindred glee.
    Launched from our hands the smooth stone skimmed the lake;
    With shouts we raised the echoes;--stiller sounds
    The lovely Girl supplied--a simple song,
    Whose low tones reached not to the distant rocks             
    To be repeated thence, but gently sank
    Into our hearts; and charmed the peaceful flood.
    Rapaciously we gathered flowery spoils
    From land and water; lilies of each hue--
    Golden and white, that float upon the waves,                 
    And court the wind; and leaves of that shy plant,
    (Her flowers were shed) the lily of the vale,
    That loves the ground, and from the sun withholds
    Her pensive beauty; from the breeze her sweets.

      Such product, and such pastime, did the place              
    And season yield; but, as we re-embarked,
    Leaving, in quest of other scenes, the shore
    Of that wild spot, the Solitary said
    In a low voice, yet careless who might hear,
    "The fire, that burned so brightly to our wish,              
    Where is it now?--Deserted on the beach--
    Dying, or dead! Nor shall the fanning breeze
    Revive its ashes. What care we for this,
    Whose ends are gained? Behold an emblem here
    Of one day's pleasure, and all mortal joys!                  
    And, in this unpremeditated slight
    Of that which is no longer needed, see
    The common course of human gratitude!"

      This plaintive note disturbed not the repose
    Of the still evening. Right across the lake                  
    Our pinnace moves; then, coasting creek and bay,
    Glades we behold, and into thickets peep,
    Where couch the spotted deer; or raised our eyes
    To shaggy steeps on which the careless goat
    Browsed by the side of dashing waterfalls;
    And thus the bark, meandering with the shore,
    Pursued her voyage, till a natural pier
    Of jutting rock invited us to land.

      Alert to follow as the Pastor led,
    We clomb a green hill's side; and, as we clomb,          
    The Valley, opening out her bosom, gave
    Fair prospect, intercepted less and less,
    O'er the flat meadows and indented coast
    Of the smooth lake, in compass seen:--far off,
    And yet conspicuous, stood the old Church-tower,
    In majesty presiding over fields
    And habitations seemingly preserved
    From all intrusion of the restless world
    By rocks impassable and mountains huge.

      Soft heath this elevated spot supplied,                  
    And choice of moss-clad stones, whereon we couched
    Or sate reclined; admiring quietly
    The general aspect of the scene; but each
    Not seldom over anxious to make known
    His own discoveries; or to favourite points                  
    Directing notice, merely from a wish
    To impart a joy, imperfect while unshared.
    That rapturous moment never shall I forget
    When these particular interests were effaced
    From every mind!--Already had the sun,                       
    Sinking with less than ordinary state,
    Attained his western bound; but rays of light--
    Now suddenly diverging from the orb
    Retired behind the mountain tops or veiled
    By the dense air--shot upwards to the crown                  
    Of the blue firmament--aloft, and wide:
    And multitudes of little floating clouds,
    Through their ethereal texture pierced--ere we,
    Who saw, of change were conscious--had become
    Vivid as fire; clouds separately poised,--                  
    Innumerable multitude of forms
    Scattered through half the circle of the sky;
    And giving back, and shedding each on each,
    With prodigal communion, the bright hues
    Which from the unapparent fount of glory                    
    They had imbibed, and ceased not to receive.
    That which the heavens displayed, the liquid deep
    Repeated; but with unity sublime!

      While from the grassy mountain's open side
    We gazed, in silence hushed, with eyes intent                
    On the refulgent spectacle, diffused
    Through earth, sky, water, and all visible space,
    The Priest in holy transport thus exclaimed:

      "Eternal Spirit! universal God!
    Power inaccessible to human thought,                         
    Save by degrees and steps which thou hast deigned
    To furnish; for this effluence of thyself,
    To the infirmity of mortal sense
    Vouchsafed; this local transitory type
    Of thy paternal splendours, and the pomp                     
    Of those who fill thy courts in highest heaven,
    The radiant Cherubim;--accept the thanks
    Which we, thy humble Creatures, here convened,
    Presume to offer; we, who--from the breast
    Of the frail earth, permitted to behold                      
    The faint reflections only of thy face--
    Are yet exalted, and in soul adore!
    Such as they are who in thy presence stand
    Unsullied, incorruptible, and drink
    Imperishable majesty streamed forth                          
    From thy empyreal throne, the elect of earth
    Shall be--divested at the appointed hour
    Of all dishonour, cleansed from mortal stain.
    --Accomplish, then, their number; and conclude
    Time's weary course! Or if, by thy decree,                   
    The consummation that will come by stealth
    Be yet far distant, let thy Word prevail,
    Oh! let thy Word prevail, to take away
    The sting of human nature. Spread the law,
    As it is written in thy holy book,                           
    Throughout all lands: let every nation hear
    The high behest, and every heart obey;
    Both for the love of purity, and hope
    Which it affords, to such as do thy will
    And persevere in good, that they shall rise,                 
    To have a nearer view of thee, in heaven.
    --Father of good! this prayer in bounty grant,
    In mercy grant it, to thy wretched sons.
    Then, nor till then, shall persecution cease,
    And cruel wars expire. The way is marked,                    
    The guide appointed, and the ransom paid.
    Alas! the nations, who of yore received
    These tidings, and in Christian temples meet
    The sacred truth to acknowledge, linger still;
    Preferring bonds and darkness to a state                     
    Of holy freedom, by redeeming love
    Proffered to all, while yet on earth detained.

      "So fare the many; and the thoughtful few,
    Who in the anguish of their souls bewail
    This dire perverseness, cannot choose but ask,               
    Shall it endure?--Shall enmity and strife,
    Falsehood and guile, be left to sow their seed;
    And the kind never perish? Is the hope
    Fallacious, or shall righteousness obtain
    A peaceable dominion, wide as earth,                         
    And ne'er to fail? Shall that blest day arrive
    When they, whose choice or lot it is to dwell
    In crowded cities, without fear shall live
    Studious of mutual benefit; and he,
    Whom Morn awakens, among dews and flowers
    Of every clime, to till the lonely field,
    Be happy in himself? The law of faith
    Working through love, such conquest shall it gain,
    Such triumph over sin and guilt achieve?
    Almighty Lord, thy further grace impart!                     
    And with that help the wonder shall be seen
    Fulfilled, the hope accomplished; and thy praise
    Be sung with transport and unceasing joy.

      "Once," and with mild demeanour, as he spake,
    On us the venerable Pastor turned                           
    His beaming eye that had been raised to Heaven,
    "Once, while the Name, Jehovah, was a sound
    Within the circuit of this sea-girt isle
    Unheard, the savage nations bowed the head
    To Gods delighting in remorseless deeds;                     
    Gods which themselves had fashioned, to promote
    Ill purposes, and flatter foul desires.
    Then, in the bosom of yon mountain-cove,
    To those inventions of corrupted man
    Mysterious rites were solemnised; and there--                
    Amid impending rocks and gloomy woods--
    Of those terrific Idols some received
    Such dismal service, that the loudest voice
    Of the swoln cataracts (which now are heard
    Soft murmuring) was too weak to overcome,                    
    Though aided by wild winds, the groans and shrieks
    Of human victims, offered up to appease
    Or to propitiate. And, if living eyes
    Had visionary faculties to see
    The thing that hath been as the thing that is,               
    Aghast we might behold this crystal Mere
    Bedimmed with smoke, in wreaths voluminous,
    Flung from the body of devouring fires,
    To Taranis erected on the heights
    By priestly hands, for sacrifice performed                   
    Exultingly, in view of open day
    And full assemblage of a barbarous host;
    Or to Andates, female Power who gave
    (For so they fancied) glorious victory.
    --A few rude monuments of mountain-stone                   
    Survive; all else is swept away.--How bright
    The appearances of things! From such, how changed
    The existing worship; and with those compared,
    The worshippers how innocent and blest!
    So wide the difference, a willing mind                      
    Might almost think, at this affecting hour,
    That paradise, the lost abode of man,
    Was raised again: and to a happy few,
    In its original beauty, here restored.

      "Whence but from thee, the true and only God,              
    And from the faith derived through Him who bled
    Upon the cross, this marvellous advance
    Of good from evil; as if one extreme
    Were left, the other gained.--O ye, who come
    To kneel devoutly in yon reverend Pile,
    Called to such office by the peaceful sound
    Of sabbath bells; and ye, who sleep in earth,
    All cares forgotten, round its hallowed walls!
    For you, in presence of this little band
    Gathered together on the green hill-side,                    
    Your Pastor is emboldened to prefer
    Vocal thanksgivings to the eternal King;
    Whose love, whose counsel, whose commands, have made
    Your very poorest rich in peace of thought
    And in good works; and him, who is endowed                   
    With scantiest knowledge, master of all truth
    Which the salvation of his soul requires.
    Conscious of that abundant favour showered
    On you, the children of my humble care,
    And this dear land, our country, while on earth              
    We sojourn, have I lifted up my soul,
    Joy giving voice to fervent gratitude.
    These barren rocks, your stern inheritance;
    These fertile fields, that recompense your pains;
    The shadowy vale, the sunny mountain-top;                    
    Woods waving in the wind their lofty heads,
    Or hushed; the roaring waters, and the still--
    They see the offering of my lifted hands,
    They hear my lips present their sacrifice,
    They know if I be silent, morn or even:
    For, though in whispers speaking, the full heart
    Will find a vent; and thought is praise to him,
    Audible praise, to thee, omniscient Mind,
    From whom all gifts descend, all blessings flow!"

      This vesper-service closed, without delay,                 
    From that exalted station to the plain
    Descending, we pursued our homeward course,
    In mute composure, o'er the shadowy lake,
    Under a faded sky. No trace remained
    Of those celestial splendours; grey the vault--              
    Pure, cloudless, ether; and the star of eve
    Was wanting; but inferior lights appeared
    Faintly, too faint almost for sight; and some
    Above the darkened hills stood boldly forth
    In twinkling lustre, ere the boat attained                  
    Her mooring-place; where, to the sheltering tree,
    Our youthful Voyagers bound fast her prow,
    With prompt yet careful hands. This done, we paced
    The dewy fields; but ere the Vicar's door
    Was reached, the Solitary checked his steps;                 
    Then, intermingling thanks, on each bestowed
    A farewell salutation; and, the like
    Receiving, took the slender path that leads
    To the one cottage in the lonely dell:
    But turned not without welcome promise made
    That he would share the pleasures and pursuits
    Of yet another summer's day, not loth
    To wander with us through the fertile vales,
    And o'er the mountain-wastes. "Another sun,"
    Said he, "shall shine upon us, ere we part;                  
    Another sun, and peradventure more;
    If time, with free consent, be yours to give,
    And season favours."
                         To enfeebled Power,
    From this communion with uninjured Minds,
    What renovation had been brought; and what                   
    Degree of healing to a wounded spirit,
    Dejected, and habitually disposed
    To seek, in degradation of the Kind,
    Excuse and solace for her own defects;
    How far those erring notions were reformed;                  
    And whether aught, of tendency as good
    And pure, from further intercourse ensued;
    This--if delightful hopes, as heretofore,
    Inspire the serious song, and gentle Hearts
    Cherish, and lofty Minds approve the past--                  
    My future labours may not leave untold.
