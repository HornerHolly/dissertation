  How blest the Maid whose heart--yet free
    From Love's uneasy sovereignty--
    Beats with a fancy running high,
    Her simple cares to magnify;
    Whom Labour, never urged to toil,                              
    Hath cherished on a healthful soil;
    Who knows not pomp, who heeds not pelf;
    Whose heaviest sin it is to look
    Askance upon her pretty Self
    Reflected in some crystal brook;                              
    Whom grief hath spared--who sheds no tear
    But in sweet pity; and can hear
    Another's praise from envy clear.

    Such (but O lavish Nature! why
    That dark unfathomable eye,                                   
    Where lurks a Spirit that replies
    To stillest mood of softest skies,
    Yet hints at peace to be o'erthrown,
    Another's first, and then her own?)
    Such, haply, yon ITALIAN Maid,                                
    Our Lady's laggard Votaress,
    Halting beneath the chestnut shade
    To accomplish there her loveliness:
    Nice aid maternal fingers lend;
    A Sister serves with slacker hand;                            
    Then, glittering like a star, she joins the festal band.

    How blest (if truth may entertain
    Coy fancy with a bolder strain)
    The HELVETIAN Girl--who daily braves,
    In her light skiff, the tossing waves,                        
    And quits the bosom of the deep
    Only to climb the rugged steep!
    --Say whence that modulated shout!
    From Wood-nymph of Diana's throng?
    Or does the greeting to a rout                                
    Of giddy Bacchanals belong?
    Jubilant outcry! rock and glade
    Resounded--but the voice obeyed
    The breath of an Helvetian Maid.

    Her beauty dazzles the thick wood;                            
    Her courage animates the flood;
    Her steps the elastic green-sward meets
    Returning unreluctant sweets;
    The mountains (as ye heard) rejoice
    Aloud, saluted by her voice!                                  
    Blithe Paragon of Alpine grace,
    Be as thou art--for through thy veins
    The blood of Heroes runs its race!
    And nobly wilt thou brook the chains
    That, for the virtuous, Life prepares;                        
    The fetters which the Matron wears;
    The patriot Mother's weight of anxious cares!

    "Sweet HIGHLAND Girl! a very shower
    Of beauty was thy earthly dower,"
    When thou didst flit before mine eyes,
    Gay Vision under sullen skies,
    While Hope and Love around thee played,
    Near the rough falls of Inversneyd!
    Have they, who nursed the blossom, seen
    No breach of promise in the fruit?                            
    Was joy, in following joy, as keen
    As grief can be in grief's pursuit?
    When youth had flown did hope still bless
    Thy goings--or the cheerfulness
    Of innocence survive to mitigate distress?                    

    But from our course why turn--to tread
    A way with shadows overspread;
    Where what we gladliest would believe
    Is feared as what may most deceive?
    Bright Spirit, not with amaranth crowned                      
    But heath-bells from thy native ground.
    Time cannot thin thy flowing hair,
    Nor take one ray of light from Thee;
    For in my Fancy thou dost share
    The gift of immortality;                                      
    And there shall bloom, with Thee allied,
    The Votaress by Lugano's side;
    And that intrepid Nymph, on Uri's steep, descried!
