A dark plume fetch me from yon blasted yew,
    Perched on whose top the Danish Raven croaks;
    Aloft, the imperial Bird of Rome invokes
    Departed ages, shedding where he flew
    Loose fragments of wild wailing, that bestrew                  
    The clouds and thrill the chambers of the rocks;
    And into silence hush the timorous flocks,
    That, calmly couching while the nightly dew
    Moistened each fleece, beneath the twinkling stars
    Slept amid that lone Camp on Hardknot's height,          
    Whose Guardians bent the knee to Jove and Mars:
    Or, near that mystic Round of Druid frame
    Tardily sinking by its proper weight
    Deep into patient Earth, from whose smooth breast it came!
