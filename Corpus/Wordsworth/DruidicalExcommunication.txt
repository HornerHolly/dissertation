Mercy and Love have met thee on thy road,
    Thou wretched Outcast, from the gift of fire
    And food cut off by sacerdotal ire,
    From every sympathy that Man bestowed!
    Yet shall it claim our reverence, that to God,                     
    Ancient of days! that to the eternal Sire,
    These jealous Ministers of law aspire,
    As to the one sole fount whence wisdom flowed,
    Justice, and order. Tremblingly escaped,
    As if with prescience of the coming storm,                        
    _That_ intimation when the stars were shaped;
    And still, 'mid yon thick woods, the primal truth
    Glimmers through many a superstitious form
    That fills the Soul with unavailing ruth.
