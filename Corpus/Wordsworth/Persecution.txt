 Lament! for Diocletian's fiery sword
    Works busy as the lightning; but instinct
    With malice ne'er to deadliest weapon linked,
    Which God's ethereal store-houses afford:
    Against the Followers of the incarnate Lord                        
    It rages;--some are smitten in the field--
    Some pierced to the heart through the ineffectual shield
    Of sacred home;--with pomp are others gored
    And dreadful respite. Thus was Alban tried,

    England's first Martyr, whom no threats could shake;
    Self-offered victim, for his friend he died,                      
    And for the faith; nor shall his name forsake
    That Hill, whose flowery platform seems to rise
    By Nature decked for holiest sacrifice.
