  Forth from a jutting ridge, around whose base
    Winds our deep Vale, two heath-clad Rocks ascend
    In fellowship, the loftiest of the pair
    Rising to no ambitious height; yet both,
    O’er lake and stream, mountain and flowery mead,              
    Unfolding prospects fair as human eyes
    Ever beheld. Up-led with mutual help,
    To one or other brow of those twin Peaks
    Were two adventurous Sisters wont to climb,
    And took no note of the hour while thence they gazed,             
    The blooming heath their couch, gazed, side by side,
    In speechless admiration. I, a witness
    And frequent sharer of their calm delight
    With thankful heart, to either Eminence
    Gave the baptismal name each Sister bore.                         
    Now are they parted, far as Death’s cold hand
    Hath power to part the Spirits of those who love
    As they did love. Ye kindred Pinnacles--
    That, while the generations of mankind
    Follow each other to their hiding-place                           
    In time’s abyss, are privileged to endure
    Beautiful in yourselves, and richly graced
    With like command of beauty--grant your aid
    For MARY’S humble, SARAH’S silent, claim,
    That their pure joy in nature may survive                         
    From age to age in blended memory.
