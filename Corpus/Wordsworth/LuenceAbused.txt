Urged by Ambition, who with subtlest skill
    Changes her means, the Enthusiast as a dupe
    Shall soar, and as a hypocrite can stoop,
    And turn the instruments of good to ill,
    Moulding the credulous people to his will.                         
    Such DUNSTAN:--from its Benedictine coop
    Issues the master Mind, at whose fell swoop
    The chaste affections tremble to fulfil
    Their purposes. Behold, pre-signified,
    The Might of spiritual sway! his thoughts, his dreams,
    Do in the supernatural world abide:                               
    So vaunt a throng of Followers, filled with pride
    In what they see of virtues pushed to extremes,
    And sorceries of talent misapplied.
