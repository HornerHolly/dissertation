 Not envying Latian shades--if yet they throw
    A grateful coolness round that crystal Spring,
    Blandusia, prattling--as when long ago
    The Sabine Bard was moved her praise to sing;
    Careless of flowers that in perennial blow                     
    Round the moist marge of Persian fountains cling;
    Heedless of Alpine torrents thundering
    Through ice-built arches radiant as heaven's bow;
    I seek the birth-place of a native Stream.--
    All hail, ye mountains! hail, thou morning light!             
    Better to breathe at large on this clear height
    Than toil in needless sleep from dream to dream:
    Pure flow the verse, pure, vigorous, free, and bright,
    For Duddon, long-loved Duddon, is my theme!
