   "Stranger,'tis no act of courage
    Which aloft thou dost discern;
    No bold _bird_ gone forth to forage
       'Mid the tempest stern;                                    
    But such mockery as the nations
    See, when public perturbations
    Lift men from their native stations,
       Like yon TUFT OF FERN;

    "Such it is; the aspiring creature
    Soaring on undaunted wing,
    (So you fancied) is by nature
       A dull helpless thing,
    Dry and withered, light and yellow;--
    _That_ to be the tempest's fellow!                            
    Wait--and you shall see how hollow
       Its endeavouring!"
