Shall then the stream of ruinous Lodore
      Not fill the valley with its changeful sound
      Unchallenged! shall grey Derwent’s sacred bound
    Hear the harsh brawl and intermittent roar
    Of mocking waves upon an iron shore,
      Whereby nor health nor happiness is found!--
      While steam-wains drag from Honister’s heart wound
    The long cooled ashes of its fiery core!

    Burst forth ye sulphurous fountains, as ye broke
      On Skiddaw, lick the waters, blast the trees,
    And let men have the earth they would desire,--
    As well go pass our children through the fire
    With shrieks, Cath-Belus, round thine altar’s smoke,
      As let old Derwent hear such sounds as these.
