The imperial Stature, the colossal stride,
    Are yet before me; yet do I behold
    The broad full visage, chest of amplest mould,
    The vestments 'broidered with barbaric pride:
    And lo! a poniard, at the Monarch's side,                          
    Hangs ready to be grasped in sympathy
    With the keen threatenings of that fulgent eye,
    Below the white-rimmed bonnet, far-descried.
    Who trembles now at thy capricious mood?
    'Mid those surrounding Worthies, haughty King,                    
    We rather think, with grateful mind sedate,
    How Providence educeth, from the spring
    Of lawless will, unlooked-for streams of good,
    Which neither force shall check nor time abate!
