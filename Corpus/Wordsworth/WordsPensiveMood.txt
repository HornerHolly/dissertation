 Those words were uttered as in pensive mood
    We turned, departing from that solemn sight:
    A contrast and reproach to gross delight,
    And lifes unspiritual pleasures daily wooed!
    But now upon this thought I cannot brood;                    
    It is unstable as a dream of night;
    Nor will I praise a cloud, however bright,
    Disparaging Mans gifts, and proper food.
    Grove, isle, with every shape of sky-built dome,
    Though clad in colours beautiful and pure,                  
    Find in the heart of man no natural home:
    The immortal Mind craves objects that endure:
    These cleave to it; from these it cannot roam,
    Nor they from it: their fellowship is secure.
