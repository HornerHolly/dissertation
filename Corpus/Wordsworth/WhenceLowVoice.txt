  Whence that low voice? A whisper from the heart,
    That told of days long past, when here I roved
    With friends and kindred tenderly beloved;
    Some who had early mandates to depart,
    Yet are allowed to steal my path athwart                       
    By Duddons side; once more do we unite,
    Once more beneath the kind Earths tranquil light;
    And smothered joys into new being start.
    From her unworthy seat, the cloudy stall
    Of Time, breaks forth triumphant Memory;                      
    Her glistening tresses bound, yet light and free
    As golden locks of birch, that rise and fall
    On gales that breathe too gently to recal
    Aught of the fading years inclemency!
