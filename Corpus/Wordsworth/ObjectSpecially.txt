Not to the object specially designed,
    Howe’er momentous in itself it be,
    Good to promote or curb depravity,
    Is the wise Legislator’s view confined.
    His Spirit, when most severe, is oft most kind;                    
    As all Authority in earth depends
    On Love and Fear, their several powers he blends,
    Copying with awe the one Paternal mind.
    Uncaught by processes in show humane,
    He feels how far the act would derogate                           
    From even the humblest functions of the State;
    If she, self-shorn of Majesty, ordain
    That never more shall hang upon her breath
    The last alternative of Life or Death.
