 Stay, little cheerful Robin! stay,
      And at my casement sing,
    Though it should prove a farewell lay
      And this our parting spring.

    Though I, alas! may neâ€™er enjoy                                    
      The promise in thy song;
    A charm, _that_ thought can not destroy,
      Doth to thy strain belong.

    Methinks that in my dying hour
      Thy song would still be dear,                                   
    And with a more than earthly power
      My passing Spirit cheer.

    Then, little Bird, this boon confer,
      Come, and my requiem sing,
    Nor fail to be the harbinger                                      
      Of everlasting Spring.
