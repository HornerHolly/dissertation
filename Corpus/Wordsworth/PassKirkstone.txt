  Within the mind strong fancies work,
    A deep delight the bosom thrills,
    Oft as I pass along the fork
    Of these fraternal hills:
    Where, save the rugged road, we find                           
    No appanage of human kind,
    Nor hint of man; if stone or rock
    Seem not his handy-work to mock
    By something cognizably shaped;
    Mockery or model roughly hewn,                          
    And left as if by earthquake strewn,
    Or from the Flood escaped:
    Altars for Druid service fit;
    (But where no fire was ever lit,
    Unless the glow-worm to the skies                             
    Thence offer nightly sacrifice)
    Wrinkled Egyptian monument;
    Green moss-grown tower; or hoary tent;
    Tents of a camp that never shall be razed--
    On which four thousand years have gazed!                      


    Ye plough-shares sparkling on the slopes!
    Ye snow-white lambs that trip
    Imprisoned 'mid the formal props
    Of restless ownership!
    Ye trees, that may to-morrow fall                        
    To feed the insatiate Prodigal!
    Lawns, houses, chattels, groves, and fields,
    All that the fertile valley shields;
    Wages of folly--baits of crime,
    Of life's uneasy game the stake,                              
    Playthings that keep the eyes awake
    Of drowsy, dotard Time;--
    O care! O guilt!--O vales and plains,
    Here, 'mid his own unvexed domains,
    A Genius dwells, that can subdue                              
    At once all memory of You,--
    Most potent when mists veil the sky,
    Mists that distort and magnify;
    While the coarse rushes, to the sweeping breeze,
    Sigh forth their ancient melodies!                            

    List to those shriller notes!--_that_ march
    Perchance was on the blast,
    When, through this Height's inverted arch,
    Rome's earliest legion passed!
    --They saw, adventurously impelled,                           
    And older eyes than theirs beheld,
    This block--and yon, whose church-like frame
    Gives to this savage Pass its name.
    Aspiring Road! that lov'st to hide
    Thy daring in a vapoury bourn,                                
    Not seldom may the hour return
    When thou shalt be my guide:
    And I (as all men may find cause,
    When life is at a weary pause,
    And they have panted up the hill                         
    Of duty with reluctant will)
    Be thankful, even though tired and faint,
    For the rich bounties of constraint;
    Whence oft invigorating transports flow
    That choice lacked courage to bestow!                         

    My Soul was grateful for delight
    That wore a threatening brow;
    A veil is lifted--can she slight
    The scene that opens now?
    Though habitation none appear,
    The greenness tells, man must be there;
    The shelter--that the p√©rspective
    Is of the clime in which we live;
    Where Toil pursues his daily round;
    Where Pity sheds sweet tears and Love,                  
    In woodbine bower or birchen grove,
    Inflicts his tender wound.
    --Who comes not hither ne'er shall know
    How beautiful the world below;
    Nor can he guess how lightly leaps                            
    The brook adown the rocky steeps,
    Farewell, thou desolate Domain!
    Hope, pointing to the cultured plain,
    Carols like a shepherd-boy;
    And who is she?--Can that be Joy!
    Who, with a sunbeam for her guide,
    Smoothly skims the meadows wide;
    While Faith, from yonder opening cloud,
    To hill and vale proclaims aloud,
    "Whate'er the weak may dread, the wicked dare,                
    Thy lot, O Man, is good, thy portion fair!"
