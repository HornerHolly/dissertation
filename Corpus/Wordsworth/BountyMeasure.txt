 Oh Bounty without measure, while the Grace
    Of Heaven doth in such wise from humblest springs
    Pour pleasures forth, and solaces that trace
    A mazy course along familiar things,
    Well may our hearts have faith that blessings come                 
    Streaming from points above the starry sky,
    With angels, when their own untroubled home
    They leave, and speed on mighty embassy
    To visit earthly chambers and for whom?
    Yea, both for souls who God forbearance try,                    
    And those that seek his help and for his mercy sigh.
