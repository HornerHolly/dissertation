  See, where his difficult way that Old Man wins
    Bent by a load of Mulberry leaves!--most hard
    Appears _his_ lot, to the small Wormâ€™s compared,
    For whom his toil with early day begins.
    Acknowledging no task-master, at will                              
    (As if her labour and her ease were twins)
    _She_ seems to work, at pleasure to lie still;--
    And softly sleeps within the thread she spins.
    So fare they--the Man serving as her Slave.
    Ere long their fates do each to each conform:                     
    Both pass into new being,--but the Worm,
    Transfigured, sinks into a hopeless grave;
    _His_ volant Spirit will, he trusts, ascend
    To bliss unbounded, glory without end.
