Not Love, not War, nor the tumultuous swell
    Of civil conflict, nor the wrecks of change,
    Nor Duty struggling with afflictions strange--
    Not these _alone_ inspire the tuneful shell;
    But where untroubled peace and concord dwell,                      
    There also is the Muse not loth to range,
    Watching the twilight smoke of cot or grange,
    Skyward ascending from a woody dell.
    Meek aspirations please her, lone endeavour,
    And sage content, and placid melancholy;                          
    She loves to gaze upon a crystal river--
    Diaphanous because it travels slowly;
    Soft is the music that would charm for ever;
    The flower of sweetest smell is shy and lowly.
