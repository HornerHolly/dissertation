 Redoubted King, of courage leonine,
    I mark thee, Richard! urgent to equip
    Thy warlike person with the staff and scrip;
    I watch thee sailing o'er the midland brine;
    In conquered Cyprus see thy Bride decline                          
    Her blushing cheek, love-vows upon her lip,
    And see love-emblems streaming from thy ship,
    As thence she holds her way to Palestine.
    My Song, a fearless homager, would attend
    Thy thundering battle-axe as it cleaves the press                 
    Of war, but duty summons her away
    To tell--how, finding in the rash distress
    Of those Enthusiasts a subservient friend,
    To giddier heights hath clomb the Papal sway.
