----Not a breath of air
    Ruffles the bosom of this leafy glen.
    From the brook margin, wide around, the trees
    Are stedfast as the rocks; the brook itself,
    Old as the hills that feed it from afar,                           
    Doth rather deepen than disturb the calm
    Where all things else are still and motionless.
    And yet, even now, a little breeze, perchance
    Escaped from boisterous winds that rage without,
    Has entered, by the sturdy oaks unfelt,                           
    But to its gentle touch how sensitive
    Is the light ash! that, pendent from the brow
    Of yon dim cave, in seeming silence makes
    A soft eye-music of slow-waving boughs,
    Powerful almost as vocal harmony                                  
    To stay the wanderer steps and soothe his thoughts.
