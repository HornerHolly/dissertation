Change me, some God, into that breathing rose
The love-sick Stripling fancifully sighs,
The envied flower beholding, as it lies
On Laura breast, in exquisite repose;

Or he would pass into her bird, that throws
The darts of song from out its wiry cage;
Enraptured could he for himself engage
The thousandth part of what the Nymph bestows
And what the little careless innocent

Ungraciously receives. Too daring choice
There are whose calmer mind it would content
To be an unculled floweret of the glen,
Fearless of plough and scythe or darkling wren
That tunes on Duddon's banks her slender voice.
