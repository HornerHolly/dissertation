 From false assumption rose, and fondly hail'd
    By superstition, spread the Papal power;
    Yet do not deem the Autocracy prevail'd
    Thus only, even in error's darkest hour.
    She daunts, forth-thundering from her spiritual tower
    Brute rapine, or with gentle lure she tames.                       
    Justice and Peace through Her uphold their claims;
    And Chastity finds many a sheltering bower.
    Realm there is none that if controul'd or sway'd
    By her commands partakes not, in degree,                          
    Of good, o'er manners arts and arms, diffused:
    Yes, to thy domination, Roman See,
    Tho' miserably, oft monstrously, abused
    By blind ambition, be this tribute paid.
