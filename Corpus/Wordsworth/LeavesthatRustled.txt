 The leaves that rustled on this oak-crowned hill,
    And sky that danced among those leaves, are still;
    Rest smooths the way for sleep; in field and bower
    Soft shades and dews have shed their blended power
    On drooping eyelid and the closing flower;                         
    Sound is there none at which the faintest heart
    Might leap, the weakest nerve of superstition start;
    Save when the Owlet's unexpected scream
    Pierces the ethereal vault; and ('mid the gleam
    Of unsubstantial imagery, the dream,                              
    From the hushed vale's realities, transferred
    To the still lake) the imaginative Bird
    Seems, 'mid inverted mountains, not unheard.

      Grave Creature!--whether, while the moon shines bright
    On thy wings opened wide for smoothest flight,                    
    Thou art discovered in a roofless tower,
    Rising from what may once have been a lady's bower;
    Or spied where thou sitt'st moping in thy mew
    At the dim centre of a churchyard yew;
    Or, from a rifted crag or ivy tod                                 
    Deep in a forest, thy secure abode,
    Thou giv'st, for pastime's sake, by shriek or shout,
    A puzzling notice of thy whereabout--
    May the night never come, nor day be seen,
    When I shall scorn thy voice or mock thy mien!                    

      In classic ages men perceived a soul
    Of sapience in thy aspect, headless Owl!
    Thee Athens reverenced in the studious grove;
    And, near the golden sceptre grasped by Jove,
    His Eagle's favourite perch, while round him sate                 
    The Gods revolving the decrees of Fate,
    Thou, too, wert present at Minerva's side:
    Hark to that second larum!--far and wide
    The elements have heard, and rock and cave replied.
