    Around a wild and woody hill
    A gravelled pathway treading,
    We reached a votive Stone that bears
    The name of Aloys Reding.

    Well judged the Friend who placed it there                     
    For silence and protection;
    And haply with a finer care
    Of dutiful affection.

    The Sun regards it from the West;
    And, while in summer glory                                    
    He sets, his sinking yields a type
    Of that pathetic story:

    And oft he tempts the patriot Swiss
    Amid the grove to linger;
    Till all is dim, save this bright Stone                       
    Touched by his golden finger.
