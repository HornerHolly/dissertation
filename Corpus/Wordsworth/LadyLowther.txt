  Lady! I rifled a Parnassian cave
    (But seldom trod) of mildly-gleaming ore;
    And culled, from sundry beds, a lucid store
    Of genuine crystals, pure as those that pave
    The azure brooks, where Dian joys to lave                      
    Her spotless limbs; and ventured to explore
    Dim shades--for reliques, upon Lethe's shore,
    Cast up at random by the sullen wave.
    To female hands the treasures were resigned;
    And lo this Work!--a grotto bright and clear                  
    From stain or taint; in which thy blameless mind
    May feed on thoughts though pensive not austere;
    Or, if thy deeper spirit be inclined
    To holy musing, it may enter here.
