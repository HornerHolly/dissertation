Bold words affirmed, in days when faith was strong
    And doubts and scruples seldom teazed the brain,
    That no adventurer's bark had power to gain
    These shores if he approached them bent on wrong;
    For, suddenly up-conjured from the Main,                           
    Mists rose to hide the Land--that search, though long
    And eager, might be still pursued in vain.
    O Fancy, what an age was _that_ for song!
    That age, when not by _laws_ inanimate,
    As men believed, the waters were impelled,                        
    The air controlled, the stars their courses held;
    But element and orb on _acts_ did wait
    Of _Powers_ endued with visible form, instinct
    With will, and to their work by passion linked.
