And what melodious sounds at times prevail!
    And, ever and anon, how bright a gleam
    Pours on the surface of the turbid Stream!
    What heartfelt fragrance mingles with the gale
    That swells the bosom of our passing sail!                         
    For where, but on _this_ River's margin, blow
    Those flowers of chivalry, to bind the brow
    Of hardihood with wreaths that shall not fail?--
    Fair Court of Edward! wonder of the world!
    I see a matchless blazonry unfurled                               
    Of wisdom, magnanimity, and love;
    And meekness tempering honourable pride;
    The lamb is couching by the lion's side,
    And near the flame-eyed eagle sits the dove.
