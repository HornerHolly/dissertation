 Here stood an Oak, that long had borne affixed
    To his huge trunk, or, with more subtle art,
    Among its withering topmost branches mixed,
    The palmy antlers of a hunted Hart,
    Whom the Dog Hercules pursued--his part                            
    Each desperately sustaining, till at last
    Both sank and died, the life-veins of the chased
    And chaser bursting here with one dire smart.
    Mutual the victory, mutual the defeat!
    High was the trophy hung with pitiless pride;                     
    Say, rather, with that generous sympathy
    That wants not, even in rudest breasts, a seat;
    And, for this feeling's sake, let no one chide
    Verse that would guard thy memory, HART'S-HORN TREE
