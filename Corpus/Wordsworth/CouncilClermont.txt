"And shall," the Pontiff asks, "profaneness flow
    From Nazareth--source of Christian piety,
    From Bethlehem, from the Mounts of Agony
    And glorified Ascension? Warriors, go,
    With prayers and blessings we your path will sow;                  
    Like Moses hold our hands erect, till ye
    Have chased far off by righteous victory
    These sons of Amalek, or laid them low!"--
    "GOD WILLETH IT," the whole assembly cry;
    Shout which the enraptured multitude astounds!
    The Council-roof and Clermont's towers reply;--
    "God willeth it," from hill to hill rebounds,
    And, in awe-stricken Countries far and nigh,
    Through "Nature's hollow arch' that voice resounds.
