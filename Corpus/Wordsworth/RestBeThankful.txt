 Doubling and doubling with laborious walk,
    Who, that has gained at length the wished-for Height,
    This brief this simple way-side Call can slight,
    And rests not thankful? Whether cheered by talk
    With some loved friend, or by the unseen hawk                      
    Whistling to clouds and sky-born streams, that shine
    At the sun's outbreak, as with light divine,
    Ere they descend to nourish root and stalk
    Of valley flowers. Nor, while the limbs repose,
    Will we forget that, as the fowl can keep                         
    Absolute stillness, poised aloft in air,
    And fishes front, unmoved, the torrent's sweep,--
    So may the Soul, through powers that Faith bestows,
    Win rest, and ease, and peace, with bliss that Angels share.
