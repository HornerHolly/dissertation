    Freed from a burden sore and grievous band,
      Dear Lord, and from this wearying world untied,
      Like a frail bark I turn me to Thy side,
      As from a fierce storm to a tranquil land.
    Thy thorns, Thy nails, and either bleeding hand,
      With Thy mild gentle piteous face, provide
      Promise of help and mercies multiplied,
      And hope that yet my soul secure may stand.
    Let not Thy holy eyes be just to see
      My evil part, Thy chastened ears to hear,
      And stretch the arm of judgment to my crime:
    Let Thy blood only love and succour me,
      Yielding more perfect pardon, better cheer,
      As older still I grow with lengthening time.
