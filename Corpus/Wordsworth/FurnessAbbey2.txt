  Well have yon Railway Labourers to THIS ground
    Withdrawn for noontide rest. They sit, they walk
    Among the Ruins, but no idle talk
    Is heard; to grave demeanour all are bound;
    And from one voice a Hymn with tuneful sound                       
    Hallows once more the long-deserted Quire
    And thrills the old sepulchral earth, around.
    Others look up, and with fixed eyes admire
    That wide-spanned arch, wondering how it was raised,
    To keep, so high in air, its strength and grace:                  
    All seem to feel the spirit of the place,
    And by the general reverence God is praised:
    Profane Despoilers, stand ye not reproved,
    While thus these simple-hearted men are moved?
