 For ever hallowed be this morning fair,
    Blest be the unconscious shore on which ye tread,
    And blest the silver Cross, which ye, instead
    Of martial banner, in procession bear;
    The Cross preceding Him who floats in air,                         
    The pictured Saviour!--By Augustin led,
    They come--and onward travel without dread,
    Chanting in barbarous ears a tuneful prayer--
    Sung for themselves, and those whom they would free!
    Rich conquest waits them:--the tempestuous sea                    
    Of Ignorance, that ran so rough and high
    And heeded not the voice of clashing swords,
    These good men humble by a few bare words,
    And calm with fear of God's divinity.
