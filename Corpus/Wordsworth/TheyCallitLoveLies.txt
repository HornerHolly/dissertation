They call it Love lies bleeding! rather say
    That in this crimson Flower Love bleeding _droops_,
    A Flower how sick in sadness! Thus it stoops
    With languid head unpropped from day to day
    From month to month, life passing not away.                       
    Even so the dying Gladiator leans
    On mother earth, and from his patience gleans
    Relics of tender thoughts, regrets that stay
    A moment and are gone. O fate-bowed flower!
    Fair as Adonis bathed in sanguine dew,                            
    Of his death-wound, _that_ Loverâ€™s heart was true
    As heaven, who pierced by scorn in some lone bower
    Could press thy semblance of unpitied smart
    Into the service of his constant heart.
