 When Alpine Vales threw forth a suppliant cry,
    The majesty of England interposed
    And the sword stopped; the bleeding wounds were closed;
    And Faith preserved her ancient purity.
    How little boots that precedent of good,                           
    Scorned or forgotten, Thou canst testify,
    For England's shame, O Sister Realm! from wood,
    Mountain, and moor, and crowded street, where lie
    The headless martyrs of the Covenant,
    Slain by Compatriot-protestants that draw                         
    From councils senseless as intolerant
    Their warrant. Bodies fall by wild sword-law;
    But who would force the Soul, tilts with a straw
    Against a Champion cased in adamant.
