 I come, ye little noisy Crew,
  Not long your pastime to prevent;
  I heard the blessing which to you
  Our common Friend and Father sent.
  I kissed his cheek before he died;                     
  And when his breath was fled,
  I raised, while kneeling by his side,
  His hand:--it dropped like lead.
  Your hands, dear Little-ones, do all
  That can be done, will never fall                     
  Like his till they are dead.
  By night or day blow foul or fair,
  Ne'er will the best of all your train
  Play with the locks of his white hair,
  Or stand between his knees again.                     

    Here did he sit confined for hours;
  But he could see the woods and plains,
  Could hear the wind and mark the showers
  Come streaming down the streaming panes.
  Now stretched beneath his grass-green mound           
  He rests a prisoner of the ground.
  He loved the breathing air,
  He loved the sun, but if it rise
  Or set, to him where now he lies,
  Brings not a moment's care.                           

  Alas! what idle words; but take
  The Dirge which for our Master's sake
  And yours, love prompted me to make.
  The rhymes so homely in attire
  With learned ears may ill agree,                      
  But chanted by your Orphan Quire
  Will make a touching melody.
