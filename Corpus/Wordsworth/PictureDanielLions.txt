 Amid a fertile region green with wood
    And fresh with rivers, well did it become
    The ducal Owner, in his palace-home
    To naturalise this tawny Lion brood;
    Children of Art, that claim strange brotherhood                    
    (Couched in their den) with those that roam at large
    Over the burning wilderness, and charge
    The wind with terror while they roar for food.
    Satiate are _these_; and stilled to eye and ear;
    Hence, while we gaze, a more enduring fear!                  
    Yet is the Prophet calm, nor would the cave
    Daunt him--if his Companions, now be-drowsed
    Outstretchedand listless, were by hunger roused:
    Man placed him here, and God, he knows, can save.
