   By Art bold privilege Warrior and War-horse stand
    On ground yet strewn with their last battle wreck;
    Let the Steed glory while his Master hand
    Lies fixed for ages on his conscious neck;
    But by the Chieftain look, though at his side                    
    Hangs that day treasured sword, how firm a check
    Is given to triumph and all human pride!
    Yon trophied Mound shrinks to a shadowy speck
    In his calm presence! Him the mighty deed
    Elates not, brought far nearer the grave rest,                  
    As shows that time-worn face, for he such seed
    Has sown as yields, we trust, the fruit of fame
    In Heaven; hence no one blushes for thy name,
    Conqueror, mid some sad thoughts, divinely blest!


    By playful smiles, alas too oft
    A sad heart sunshine by a soft
    And gentle nature, and a free
    Yet modest hand of charity,
    Through life was OWEN LLOYD endeared                               
    To young and old; and how revered
    Had been that pious spirit, a tide
    Of humble mourners testified,
    When, after pains dispensed to prove
    The measure of God chastening love,                             
    Here, brought from far, his corse found rest,--
    Fulfilment of his own request;--
    Urged less for this Yew shade, though he
    Planted with such fond hope the tree;
    Less for the love of stream and rock,                             
    Dear as they were, than that his Flock,
    When they no more their Pastor voice
    Could hear to guide them in their choice
    Through good and evil, help might have,
    Admonished, from his silent grave,                                
    Of righteousness, of sins forgiven,
    For peace on earth and bliss in heaven.
