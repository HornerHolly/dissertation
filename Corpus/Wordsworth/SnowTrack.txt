The snow-tracks of my friends I see,
    Their foot-marks do not trouble me,
    For ever left alone am I.
    Then wherefore should I fear to die
    They to the last my friends did cherish                            
    And to the last were good and kind,
    Methinks tis strange I did not perish
    The moment I was left behind.

    Why do I watch those running deer?
    And wherefore, wherefore come they here?                          
    And wherefore do I seem to love
    The things that live, the things that move?
    Why do I look upon the sky?
    I do not live for what I see.
    Why open thus mine eyes? To die                                   
    Is all that now is left for me,
    If I could smother up my heart
    My life would then at once depart.
    My friends, you live, and yet you seem
    To me the people of a dream;                                      
    A dream in which there is no love,
    And yet, my friends, you live and move.

    When I could live without a pain,
    And feel no wish to be alive,
    In quiet hopelessness I sleep,                                    
    Alas! how quiet, and how deep!

    Oh no! I do not, cannot rue,
    I did not strive to follow you.
    I might have droppd, and died alone
    On unknown snows, a spot unknown.                                 
    This spot to me must needs be dear,
    Of my dear friends I see the trace.
    You saw me, friends, you laid me here,
    You know where my poor bones shall be,
    Then wherefore should I fear to die?                              
    Alas that one beloved, forlorn,
    Should lie beneath the cold starlight!
    With them I think I could have borne
    The journey of another night,
    And with my friends now far away                                  
    I could have lived another day.
