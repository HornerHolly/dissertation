 How clear, how keen, how marvellously bright
    The effluence from yon distant mountain's head,
    Which, strewn with snow smooth as the sky can shed,
    Shines like another sun--on mortal sight
    Uprisen, as if to check approaching Night,                     
    And all her twinkling stars. Who now would tread,
    If so he might, yon mountain's glittering head--
    Terrestrial, but a surface, by the flight
    Of sad mortality's earth-sullying wing,
    Unswept, unstained? Nor shall the aÃ«rial Powers               
    Dissolve that beauty, destined to endure,
    White, radiant, spotless, exquisitely pure,
    Through all vicissitudes, till genial Spring
    Has filled the laughing vales with welcome flowers.
