 The tears of man in various measure gush
    From various sources; gently overflow
    From blissful transport some--from clefts of woe
    Some with ungovernable impulse rush;
    And some, coÃ«val with the earliest blush                           
    Of infant passion, scarcely dare to show
    Their pearly lustre--coming but to go;
    And some break forth when others' sorrows crush
    The sympathising heart. Nor these, nor yet
    The noblest drops to admiration known,                            
    To gratitude, to injuries forgiven--
    Claim Heaven's regard like waters that have wet
    The innocent eyes of youthful Monarchs driven
    To pen the mandates, nature doth disown.
