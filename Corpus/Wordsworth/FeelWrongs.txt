   Feel for the wrongs to universal ken
    Daily exposed, woe that unshrouded lies;
    And seek the Sufferer in his darkest den,
    Whether conducted to the spot by sighs
    And moanings, or he dwells (as if the wren                         
    Taught him concealment) hidden from all eyes
    In silence and the awful modesties
    Of sorrow;--feel for all, as brother Men!
    Rest not in hope wantâ€™s icy chain to thaw
    By casual boons and formal charities;
    Learn to be just, just through impartial law;
    Far as ye may, erect and equalise;
    And, what ye cannot reach by statute, draw
    Each from his fountain of self-sacrifice!
