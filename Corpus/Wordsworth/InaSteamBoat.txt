 Arran! a single-crested Teneriffe,
    A St. Helena next--in shape and hue,
    Varying her crowded peaks and ridges blue;
    Who but must covet a cloud-seat, or skiff
    Built for the air, or winged Hippogriff?                           
    That he might fly, where no one could pursue,
    From this dull Monster and her sooty crew;
    And, as a God, light on thy topmost cliff.
    Impotent wish! which reason would despise
    If the mind knew no union of extremes,                            
    Ambition frames, and heart-humilities.
    Beneath stern mountains many a soft vale lies,
    And lofty springs give birth to lowly streams.
