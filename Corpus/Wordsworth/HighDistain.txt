  Tis He whose yester-evening high disdain
    Beat back the roaring storm but how subdued
    His day break note, a sad vicissitude
    Does the hour drowsy weight his glee restrain
    Or, like the nightingale, her joyous vein                          
    Pleased to renounce, does this dear Thrush attune
    His voice to suit the temper of yon Moon
    Doubly depressed, setting, and in her wane?
    Rise, tardy Sun! and let the Songster prove
    The balance trembling between night and morn                     
    No longer with what ecstasy upborne
    He can pour forth his spirit. In heaven above,
    And earth below, they best can serve true gladness
    Who meet most feelingly the calls of sadness.
