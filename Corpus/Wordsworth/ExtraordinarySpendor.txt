 Had this effulgence disappeared
    With flying haste, I might have sent,
    Among the speechless clouds, a look
    Of blank astonishment;
    But 'tis endued with power to stay,                            
    And sanctify one closing day,
    That frail Mortality may see--
    What is?--ah no, but what _can_ be!
    Time was when field and watery cove
    With modulated echoes rang,                                   
    While choirs of fervent Angels sang
    Their vespers in the grove;
    Or, crowning, star-like, each some sovereign height,
    Warbled, for heaven above and earth below,
    Strains, suitable to both.--Such holy rite,                   
    Methinks, if audibly repeated now
    From hill or valley, could not move
    Sublimer transport, purer love,
    Than doth this silent spectacle--the gleam--
    The shadow--and the peace supreme!                            

    No sound is uttered,--but a deep
    And solemn harmony pervades
    The hollow vale from steep to steep,
    And penetrates the glades.
    Far-distant images draw nigh,                                 
    Called forth by wondrous potency
    Of beamy radiance, that imbues
    Whate'er it strikes, with gem-like hues!
    In vision exquisitely clear,
    Herds range along the mountain side;                     
    And glistening antlers are descried;
    And gilded flocks appear.
    Thine is the tranquil hour, purpureal Eve!
    But long as god-like wish, or hope divine,
    Informs my spirit, ne'er can I believe                        
    That this magnificence is wholly thine!
    --From worlds not quickened by the sun
    A portion of the gift is won;
    An intermingling of Heaven's pomp is spread
    On ground which British shepherds tread!                      

    And, if there be whom broken ties
    Afflict, or injuries assail,
    Yon hazy ridges to their eyes
    Present a glorious scale,
    Climbing suffused with sunny air,                             
    To stop--no record hath told where!
    And tempting Fancy to ascend,
    And with immortal Spirits blend!
    --Wings at my shoulders seem to play;
    But, rooted here, I stand and gaze                            
    On those bright steps that heaven-ward raise
    Their practicable way.
    Come forth, ye drooping old men, look abroad,
    And see to what fair countries ye are bound!
    And if some traveller, weary of his road,                     
    Hath slept since noontide on the grassy ground,
    Ye Genii! to his covert speed;
    And wake him with such gentle heed
    As may attune his soul to meet the dower
    Bestowed on this transcendent hour!                           

    Such hues from their celestial Urn
    Were wont to stream before mine eye,
    Where'er it wandered in the morn
    Of blissful infancy.
    This glimpse of glory, why renewed?                           
    Nay, rather speak with gratitude;
    For, if a vestige of those gleams
    Survived, 'twas only in my dreams.
    Dread Power! whom peace and calmness serve
    No less than Nature's threatening voice,
    If aught unworthy be my choice,
    From THEE if I would swerve;
    Oh, let thy grace remind me of the light
    Full early lost, and fruitlessly deplored;
    Which, at this moment, on my waking sight                     
    Appears to shine, by miracle restored;
    My soul, though yet confined to earth,
    Rejoices in a second birth!
    --'Tis past, the visionary splendour fades;
    And night approaches with her shades.
