 The Baptist might have been ordaind to cry
    Forth from the towers of that huge Pile, wherein
    His Father served Jehovah but how win
    Due audience, how for aught but scorn defy
    The obstinate pride and wanton revelry                             
    Of the Jerusalem below, her sin
    And folly, if they with united din
    Drown not at once mandate and prophecy
    Therefore the Voice spake from the Desert, thence
    To Her, as to her opposite in peace,                              
    Silence, and holiness, and innocence,
    To Her and to all Lands its warning sent,
    Crying with earnestness that might not cease,
    Make straight a highway for the Lord repent
