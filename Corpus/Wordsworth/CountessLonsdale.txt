 Lady! a Pen (perhaps with thy regard,
    Among the Favoured, favoured not the least)
    Left, mid the Records of this Book inscribed,
    Deliberate traces, registers of thought
    And feeling, suited to the place and time                          
    That gave them birth:--months passed, and still this hand,
    That had not been too timid to imprint
    Words which the virtues of thy Lord inspired,
    Was yet not bold enough to write of Thee.
    And why that scrupulous reserve? In sooth                         
    The blameless cause lay in the Theme itself.
    Flowers are there many that delight to strive
    With the sharp wind, and seem to court the shower,
    Yet are by nature careless of the sun
    Whether he shine on them or not; and some,                        
    Wherever he moves along the unclouded sky,
    Turn a broad front full on his flattering beams:
    Others do rather from their notice shrink,
    Loving the dewy shade,--a humble band,
    Modest and sweet, a progeny of earth,                             
    Congenial with thy mind and character,
    High-born Augusta!
                        Witness Towers, and Groves!
    And Thou, wild Stream, that givst the honoured name
    Of Lowther to this ancient Line, bear witness
    From thy most secret haunts; and ye Parterres,                    
    Which She is pleased and proud to call her own,
    Witness how oft upon my noble Friend
    _Mute_ offerings, tribute from an inward sense
    Of admiration and respectful love,
    Have waited till the affections could no more                    
    Endure that silence, and broke out in song,
    Snatches of music taken up and dropt
    Like those self-solacing, those under, notes
    Trilled by the redbreast, when autumnal leaves
    Are thin upon the bough. Mine, only mine,                         
    The pleasure was, and no one heard the praise,
    Checked, in the moment of its issue, checked
    And reprehended, by a fancied blush
    From the pure qualities that called it forth.

      Thus Virtue lives debarred from Virtue meed;                  
    Thus, Lady, is retiredness a veil
    That, while it only spreads a softening charm
    Oer features looked at by discerning eyes,
    Hides half their beauty from the common gaze;
    And thus, even on the exposed and breezy hill                 
    Of lofty station, female goodness walks,
    When side by side with lunar gentleness,
    As in a cloister. Yet the grateful Poor
    (Such the immunities of low estate,
    Plain Nature enviable privilege,                                
    Her sacred recompense for many wants)
    Open their hearts before Thee, pouring out
    All that they think and feel, with tears of joy;
    And benedictions not unheard in heaven:
    And friend in the ear of friend, where speech is free             
    To follow truth, is eloquent as they.

      Then let the Book receive in these prompt lines
    A just memorial; and thine eyes consent
    To read that they, who mark thy course, behold
    A life declining with the golden light                            
    Of summer, in the season of sere leaves;
    See cheerfulness undamped by stealing Time;
    See studied kindness flow with easy stream,
    Illustrated with inborn courtesy;
    And an habitual disregard of self                                 
    Balanced by vigilance for others weal.

      And shall the Verse not tell of lighter gifts
    With these ennobling attributes conjoined
    And blended, in peculiar harmony,
    By Youth surviving spirit? What agile grace!                    
    A nymph-like liberty, in nymph-like form,
    Beheld with wonder; whether floor or path
    Thou tread; or sweep--borne on the managed steed--
    Fleet as the shadows, over down or field,
    Driven by strong winds at play among the clouds.                  

      Yet one word more--one farewell word--a wish
    Which came, but it has passed into a prayer--
    That, as thy sun in brightness is declining,
    So--at an hour yet distant for _their_ sakes
    Whose tender love, here faltering on the way                      
    Of a diviner love, will be forgiven--
    So may it set in peace, to rise again
    For everlasting glory won by faith.
