 One might believe that natural miseries
  Had blasted France, and made of it a land
  Unfit for men; and that in one great band
  Her sons were bursting forth, to dwell at ease.
  But 'tis a chosen soil, where sun and breeze                   
  Shed gentle favours: rural works are there,
  And ordinary business without care;
  Spot rich in all things that can soothe and please!
  How piteous then that there should be such dearth
  Of knowledge; that whole myriads should unite                 
  To work against themselves such fell despite:
  Should come in phrensy and in drunken mirth,
  Impatient to put out the only light
  Of Liberty that yet remains on earth!
