 Her only pilot the soft breeze, the boat
    Lingers, but Fancy is well satisfied;
    With keen-eyed Hope, with Memory, at her side,
    And the glad Muse at liberty to note
    All that to each is precious, as we float                          
    Gently along; regardless who shall chide
    If the heavens smile, and leave us free to glide,
    Happy Associates breathing air remote
    From trivial cares. But, Fancy and the Muse,
    Why have I crowded this small bark with you                       
    And others of your kind, ideal crew!
    While here sits One whose brightness owes its hues
    To flesh and blood; no Goddess from above,
    No fleeting Spirit, but my own true Love?
