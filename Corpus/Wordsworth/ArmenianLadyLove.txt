  You have heard "a Spanish Lady
            How she wooed an English man;"
          Hear now of a fair Armenian,
            Daughter of the proud Sold√†n;
    How she loved a Christian Slave, and told her pain                 
    By word, look, deed, with hope that he might love again.


          "Pluck that rose, it moves my liking,"
            Said she, lifting up her veil;
          "Pluck it for me, gentle gardener,
            Ere it wither and grow pale."                             
    "Princess fair, I till the ground, but may not take
    From twig or bed an humbler flower, even for your sake!"


          "Grieved am I, submissive Christian!
            To behold thy captive state;
          Women, in your land, may pity                               
            (May they not?) the unfortunate."
    "Yes, kind Lady! otherwise man could not bear
    Life, which to every one that breathes is full of care."

          "Worse than idle is compassion
            If it end in tears and sighs;                             
          Thee from bondage would I rescue
            And from vile indignities;
    Nurtured, as thy mien bespeaks, in high degree,
    Look up--and help a hand that longs to set thee free."


          "Lady! dread the wish, nor venture                          
            In such peril to engage;
          Think how it would stir against you
            Your most loving father's rage:
    Sad deliverance would it be, and yoked with shame,
    Should troubles overflow on her from whom it came."               


          "Generous Frank! the just in effort
            Are of inward peace secure:
          Hardships for the brave encountered,
            Even the feeblest may endure:
    If almighty grace through me thy chains unbind                    
    My father for slave's work may seek a slave in mind."


          "Princess, at this burst of goodness,
            My long-frozen heart grows warm!"
          "Yet you make all courage fruitless,
            Me to save from chance of harm:                           
    Leading such companion I that gilded dome,
    Yon minarets, would gladly leave for his worst home."

          "Feeling tunes your voice, fair Princess!
            And your brow is free from scorn,
          Else these words would come like mockery,                   
            Sharper than the pointed thorn."
    "Whence the undeserved mistrust? Too wide apart
    Our faith hath been,--O would that eyes could see the heart!"


          "Tempt me not, I pray; my doom is
            These base implements to wield;                           
          Rusty lance, I ne'er shall grasp thee,
            Ne'er assoil my cobwebb'd shield!
    Never see my native land, nor castle towers,
    Nor Her who thinking of me there counts widowed hours."

          "Prisoner! pardon youthful fancies;                        
            Wedded? If you _can_, say no!
          Blessed is and be your consort;
            Hopes I cherished--let them go!
    Handmaid's privilege would leave my purpose free,
    Without another link to my felicity."                           


          "Wedded love with loyal Christians,
            Lady, is a mystery rare;
          Body, heart, and soul in union,
            Make one being of a pair."
    "Humble love in me would look for no return,                    
    Soft as a guiding star that cheers, but cannot burn."


          "Gracious Allah! by such title
            Do I dare to thank the God,
          Him who thus exalts thy spirit,
            Flower of an unchristian sod!                         
    Or hast thou put off wings which thou in heaven dost wear?
    What have I seen, and heard or dreamt? where am I? where?"

                       
          Here broke off the dangerous converse:
            Less impassioned words might tell
          How the pair escaped together,                   
            Tears not wanting, nor a knell
    Of sorrow in her heart while through her father's door,
    And from her narrow world, she passed for evermore.


          But affections higher, holier,
            Urged her steps; she shrunk from trust                
          In a sensual creed that trampled
            Woman's birthright into dust.
    Little be the wonder then, the blame be none,
    If she, a timid Maid, hath put such boldness on.

          Judge both Fugitives with knowledge:                       
            In those old romantic days
          Mighty were the soul's commandments
            To support, restrain, or raise.
    Foes might hang upon their path, snakes rustle near,
    But nothing from their inward selves had they to fear.            


          Thought infirm ne'er came between them,
            Whether printing desert sands
          With accordant steps, or gathering
            Forest-fruit with social hands;                           
    Or whispering like two reeds that in the cold moonbeam
    Bend with the breeze their heads, beside a crystal stream.

          On a friendly deck reposing
            They at length for Venice steer;
          There, when they had closed their voyage,
            One, who daily on the pier                               
    Watched for tidings from the East, beheld his Lord,
    Fell down and clasped his knees for joy, not uttering word.

          Mutual was the sudden transport;
            Breathless questions followed fast,
          Years contracting to a moment,                             
            Each word greedier than the last;
    "Hie thee to the Countess, friend! return with speed,
    And of this Stranger speak by whom her lord was freed.


          Say that I, who might have languished,
            Drooped and pined till life was spent,                  
          Now before the gates of Stolberg
            My Deliverer would present
    For a crowning recompense, the precious grace
    Of her who in my heart still holds her ancient place.


          Make it known that my Companion                            
            Is of royal eastern blood,
          Thirsting after all perfection,
            Innocent, and meek, and good,
    Though with misbelievers bred; but that dark night
    Will holy Church disperse by beams of gospel-light."             


          Swiftly went that grey-haired Servant,
            Soon returned a trusty Page
          Charged with greetings, benedictions,
            Thanks and praises, each a gage
    For a sunny thought to cheer the Stranger's way,                 
    Her virtuous scruples to remove, her fears allay.

          And how blest the Reunited,
            While beneath their castle-walls,
          Runs a deafening noise of welcome!--
            Blest, though every tear that falls                      
    Doth in its silence of past sorrow tell,
    And makes a meeting seem most like a dear farewell.

          Through a haze of human nature,
            Glorified by heavenly light,
          Looked the beautiful Deliverer                             
            On that overpowering sight,
    While across her virgin cheek pure blushes strayed,
    For every tender sacrifice her heart had made.


          On the ground the weeping Countess
            Knelt, and kissed the Stranger's hand;                   
          Act of soul-devoted homage,
            Pledge of an eternal band:
    Nor did aught of future days that kiss belie,
    Which, with a generous shout, the crowd did ratify.


          Constant to the fair Armenian,                             
            Gentle pleasures round her moved,
          Like a tutelary spirit
            Reverenced, like a sister, loved.
    Christian meekness smoothed for all the path of life,            
    Who, loving most, should wiseliest love, their only strife.

          Mute memento of that union
            In a Saxon church survives,
          Where a cross-legged Knight lies sculptured
            As between two wedded Wives--
    Figures with armorial signs of race and birth,                   
    And the vain rank the pilgrims bore while yet on earth.
