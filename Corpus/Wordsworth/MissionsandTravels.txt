Not sedentary all: there are who roam
    To scatter seeds of life on barbarous shores;
    Or quit with zealous step their knee-worn floors
    To seek the general mart of Christendom;
    Whence they, like richly-laden merchants, come                     
    To their belov√®d cells:--or shall we say
    That, like the Red-cross Knight, they urge their way,
    To lead in memorable triumph home
    Truth, their immortal Una? Babylon,
    Learned and wise, hath perished utterly,                          
    Nor leaves her Speech one word to aid the sigh
    That would lament her;--Memphis, Tyre, are gone
    With all their Arts,--but classic lore glides on
    By these Religious saved for all posterity.
