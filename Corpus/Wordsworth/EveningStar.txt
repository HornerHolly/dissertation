  The Lake is thine,
    The mountains too are thine, some clouds there are,
    Some little feeble stars, but all is thine,
    Thou, thou art king, and sole proprietor.

    A moon among her stars, a mighty vale,                             
    Fresh as the freshest field, scoopâ€™d out, and green
    As is the greenest billow of the sea.

    The multitude of little rocky hills,
    Rocky or green, that do like islands rise
    From the flat meadow lonely there.                                
    
    Embowering mountains, and the dome of Heaven
    And waters in the midst, a Second Heaven.
