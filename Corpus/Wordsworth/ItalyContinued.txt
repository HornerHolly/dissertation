 As indignation mastered grief, my tongue
    Spake bitter words; words that did ill agree
    With those rich stores of Nature’s imagery,
    And divine Art, that fast to memory clung--
    Thy gifts, magnificent Region, ever young                          
    In the sun’s eye, and in his sister’s sight
    How beautiful! how worthy to be sung
    In strains of rapture, or subdued delight!
    I feign not; witness that unwelcome shock
    That followed the first sound of German speech,                   
    Caught the far-winding barrier Alps among.
    In that announcement, greeting seemed to mock
    Parting; the casual word had power to reach
    My heart, and filled that heart with conflict strong.
