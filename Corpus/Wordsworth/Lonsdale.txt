Lonsdale! it were unworthy of a Guest,
    Whose heart with gratitude to thee inclines,
    If he should speak, by fancy touched, of signs
    On thy Abode harmoniously imprest,
    Yet be unmoved with wishes to attest                               
    How in thy mind and moral frame agree
    Fortitude, and that Christian Charity
    Which, filling, consecrates the human breast.
    And if the Motto on thy 'scutcheon teach
    With truth, "THE MAGISTRACY SHOWS THE MAN;"
    _That_ searching test thy public course has stood;
    As will be owned alike by bad and good,
    Soon as the measuring of life's little span
    Shall place thy virtues out of Envy's reach.
