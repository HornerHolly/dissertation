Nor wants the cause the panic-striking aid
    Of hallelujahs tost from hill to hill--
    For instant victory. But Heaven's high will
    Permits a second and a darker shade
    Of Pagan night. Afflicted and dismayed,                            
    The Relics of the sword flee to the mountains:
    O wretched Land! whose tears have flowed like fountains;
    Whose arts and honours in the dust are laid
    By men yet scarcely conscious of a care
    For other monuments than those of Earth;
    Who, as the fields and woods have given them birth,
    Will build their savage fortunes only there;
    Content, if foss, and barrow, and the girth
    Of long-drawn rampart, witness what they were.
