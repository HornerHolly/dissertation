Shun not this rite, neglected, yea abhorred,
    By some of unreflecting mind, as calling
    Man to curse man, (thought monstrous and appalling.)
    Go thou and hear the threatenings of the _Lord_;
    Listening within his Temple see his sword                          
    Unsheathed in wrath to strike the offender's head,
    Thy own, if sorrow for thy sin be dead,
    Guilt unrepented, pardon unimplored.
    Two aspects bears Truth needful for salvation;
    Who knows not _that_?--yet would this delicate age                
    Look only on the Gospel's brighter page:
    Let light and dark duly our thoughts employ;
    So shall the fearful words of Commination
    Yield timely fruit of peace and love and joy.
