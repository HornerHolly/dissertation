As faith thus sanctified the warrior's crest
    While from the Papal Unity there came,
    What feebler means had fail'd to give, one aim
    Diffused thro' all the regions of the West;
    So does her Unity its power attest                                 
    By works of Art, that shed, on the outward frame
    Of worship, glory and grace, which who shall blame
    That ever looked to heaven for final rest?
    Hail countless Temples! that so well befit
    Your ministry; that, as ye rise and take                          
    Form spirit and character from holy writ,
    Give to devotion, wheresoe'er awake,
    Pinions of high and higher sweep, and make
    The unconverted soul with awe submit.
