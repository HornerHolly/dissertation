Nor scorn the aid which Fancy oft doth lend
    The Soul's eternal interests to promote:
    Death, darkness, danger, are our natural lot;
    And evil Spirits _may_ our walk attend
    For aught the wisest know or comprehend;                           
    Then be _good_ Spirits free to breathe a note
    Of elevation; let their odours float
    Around these Converts; and their glories blend,
    The midnight stars outshining, or the blaze
    Of the noon-day. Nor doubt that golden cords                      
    Of good works, mingling with the visions, raise
    The Soul to purer worlds: and _who_ the line
    Shall draw, the limits of the power define,
    That even imperfect faith to man affords?
