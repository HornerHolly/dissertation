 Deplorable his lot who tills the ground,
    His whole life long tills it, with heartless toil
    Of villain-service, passing with the soil
    To each new Master, like a steer or hound,
    Or like a rooted tree, or stone earth-bound;                       
    But mark how gladly, through their own domains,
    The Monks relax or break these iron chains;
    While Mercy, uttering, through their voice, a sound
    Echoed in Heaven, cries out, "Ye Chiefs, abate
    These legalized oppressions! Man--whose name                      
    And nature God disdained not; Man--whose soul
    Christ died for--cannot forfeit his high claim
    To live and move exempt from all controul
    Which fellow-feeling doth not mitigate!"
