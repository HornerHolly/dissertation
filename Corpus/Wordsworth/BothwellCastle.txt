 Immured in Bothwell's Towers, at times the Brave
    (So beautiful is Clyde) forgot to mourn
    The liberty they lost at Bannockburn.
    Once on those steeps _I_ roamed at large, and have
    In mind the landscape, as if still in sight;                      
    The river glides, the woods before me wave;
    Then why repine that now in vain I crave
    Needless renewal of an old delight?
    Better to thank a dear and long-past day
    For joy its sunny hours were free to give                         
    Than blame the present, that our wish hath crost.
    Memory, like sleep, hath powers which dreams obey,
    Dreams, vivid dreams, that are not fugitive:
    How little that she cherishes is lost!
