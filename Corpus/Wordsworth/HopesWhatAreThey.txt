   Hopes, what are they?--Beads of morning
    Strung on slender blades of grass;
    Or a spider's web adorning
    In a strait and treacherous pass.

    What are fears but voices airy?                                
    Whispering harm where harm is not;
    And deluding the unwary 
    Till the fatal bolt is shot!

    What is glory?--in the socket
    See how dying tapers fare!                                    
    What is pride?--a whizzing rocket
    That would emulate a star.

    What is friendship?--do not trust her,
    Nor the vows which she has made;
    Diamonds dart their brightest lustre                          
    From a palsy-shaken head.

    What is truth?--a staff rejected;
    Duty?--an unwelcome clog;
    Joy?--a moon by fits reflected
    In a swamp or watery bog;

    Bright, as if through ether steering,
    To the Traveller's eye it shone:
    He hath hailed it re-appearing--
    And as quickly it is gone;

    Such is Joy--as quickly hidden,
    Or mis-shapen to the sight,
    And by sullen weeds forbidden
    To resume its native light.

    What is youth?--a dancing billow,
    (Winds behind, and rocks before!)
    Age?--a drooping, tottering willow
    On a flat and lazy shore.

    What is peace?--when pain is over,
    And love ceases to rebel,
    Let the last faint sigh discover                              
    That precedes the passing knell!
