  But, to remote Northumbria royal Hall,
    Where thoughtful Edwin, tutored in the school
    Of sorrow, still maintains a heathen rule,
    _Who_ comes with functions apostolical
    Mark him, of shoulders curved, and stature tall,               
    Black hair, and vivid eye, and meagre cheek,
    His prominent feature like an eagle beak;
    A Man whose aspect doth at once appal
    And strike with reverence. The Monarch leans
    Toward the pure truths this Delegate propounds,               
    Repeatedly his own deep mind he sounds
    With careful hesitation then convenes
    A synod of his Councillors give ear,
    And what a pensive Sage doth utter, hear!
