How rich that forehead's calm expanse!
    How bright that heaven-directed glance!
    --Waft her to glory, wing√®d Powers,
    Ere sorrow be renewed,
    And intercourse with mortal hours                                  
    Bring back a humbler mood!
    So looked Cecilia when she drew
    An Angel from his station;
    So looked; not ceasing to pursue
    Her tuneful adoration!                                            

    But hand and voice alike are still;
    No sound _here_ sweeps away the will
    That gave it birth: in service meek
    One upright arm sustains the cheek,
    And one across the bosom lies--                                   
    That rose, and now forgets to rise,
    Subdued by breathless harmonies
    Of meditative feeling;
    Mute strains from worlds beyond the skies,
    Through the pure light of female eyes,                            
    Their sanctity revealing!
