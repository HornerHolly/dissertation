  I rose while yet the cattle, heat-opprest,
    Crowded together under rustling trees
    Brushed by the current of the water-breeze;
    And for _their_ sakes, and love of all that rest,
    On Duddon's margin, in the sheltering nest;                    
    For all the startled scaly tribes that slink
    Into his coverts, and each fearless link
    Of dancing insects forged upon his breast;
    For these, and hopes and recollections worn
    Close to the vital seat of human clay;                        
    Glad meetings, tender partings, that upstay
    The drooping mind of absence, by vows sworn
    In his pure presence near the trysting thorn--
    I thanked the Leader of my onward way.
