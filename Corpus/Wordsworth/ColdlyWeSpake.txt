Coldly we spake. The Saxons, overpowered
    By wrong triumphant through its own excess,
    From fields laid waste, from house and home devoured
    By flames, look up to heaven and crave redress
    From God's eternal justice. Pitiless                               
    Though men be, there are angels that can feel
    For wounds that death alone has power to heal,
    For penitent guilt, and innocent distress.
    And has a Champion risen in arms to try
    His Country's virtue, fought, and breathes no more;               
    Him in their hearts the people canonize;
    And far above the mine's most precious ore
    The least small pittance of bare mould they prize
    Scooped from the sacred earth where his dear relics lie.
