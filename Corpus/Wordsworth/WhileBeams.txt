 While beams of orient light shoot wide and high,
    Deep in the vale a little rural Town
    Breathes forth a cloud like creature of its own,
    That mounts not toward the radiant morning sky,
    But, with a less ambitious sympathy,                              
    Hangs oer its Parent waking to the cares
    Troubles and toils that every day prepares.
    So Fancy, to the musing Poets eye,
    Endears that Lingerer. And how blest her sway
    (Like influence never may my soul reject)
    If the calm Heaven, now to its zenith decked
    With glorious forms in numberless array,
    To the lone shepherd on the hills disclose
    Gleams from a world in which the saints repose.
