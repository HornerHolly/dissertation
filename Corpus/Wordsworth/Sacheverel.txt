A sudden conflict rises from the swell
    Of a proud slavery met by tenets strained
    In Liberty's behalf. Fears, true or feigned,
    Spread through all ranks; and lo! the Sentinel
    Who loudest rang his pulpit 'larum bell                            
    Stands at the Bar, absolved by female eyes
    Mingling their glances with grave flatteries
    Lavished on _Him_--that England may rebel
    Against her ancient virtue. HIGH and LOW,
    Watch-words of Party, on all tongues are rife;                   
    As if a Church, though sprung from heaven, must owe
    To opposites and fierce extremes her life,--
    Not to the golden mean, and quiet flow
    Of truths that soften hatred, temper strife.
