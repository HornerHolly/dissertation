Father! to God himself we cannot give
    A holier name! then lightly do not bear
    Both names conjoined, but of thy spiritual care
    Be duly mindful: still more sensitive
    Do Thou, in truth a second Mother, strive
    Against disheartening custom, that by Thee
    Watched, and with love and pious industry
    Tended at need, the adopted Plant may thrive
    For everlasting bloom. Benign and pure
    This Ordinance, whether loss it would supply,                    
    Prevent omission, help deficiency,
    Or seek to make assurance doubly sure.
    Shame if the consecrated Vow be found
    An idle form, the Word an empty sound!
