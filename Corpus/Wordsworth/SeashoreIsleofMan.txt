 Why stand we gazing on the sparkling Brine,
    With wonder smit by its transparency,
    And all-enraptured with its purity?--
    Because the unstained, the clear, the crystalline,
    Have ever in them something of benign;                             
    Whether in gem, in water, or in sky,
    A sleeping infant's brow, or wakeful eye
    Of a young maiden, only not divine.
    Scarcely the hand forbears to dip its palm
    For beverage drawn as from a mountain-well.                       
    Temptation centres in the liquid Calm;
    Our daily raiment seems no obstacle
    To instantaneous plunging in, deep Sea!
    And revelling in long embrace with thee.
