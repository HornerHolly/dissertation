 True is it that Ambrosio Salinero
    With an untoward fate was long involved
    In odious litigation; and full long,
    Fate harder still! had he to endure assaults
    Of racking malady. And true it is                            
    That not the less a frank courageous heart
    And buoyant spirit triumphed over pain;
    And he was strong to follow in the steps
    Of the fair Muses. Not a covert path
    Leads to the dear Parnassian forest's shade,                
    That might from him be hidden; not a track
    Mounts to pellucid Hippocrene, but he
    Had traced its windings This Savona knows,
    Yet no sepulchral honours to her Son
    She paid, for in our age the heart is ruled                 
    Only by gold. And now a simple stone
    Inscribed with this memorial here is raised
    By his bereft, his lonely, Chiabrera.
    Think not, O Passenger! who read'st the lines
    That an exceeding love hath dazzled me;                    
    No--he was One whose memory ought to spread
    Where'er Permessus bears an honoured name,
    And live as long as its pure stream shall flow.
