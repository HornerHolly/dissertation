Those had given earliest notice, as the lark
    Springs from the ground the morn to gratulate;
    Or rather rose the day to antedate,
    By striking out a solitary spark,                                  
    When all the world with midnight gloom was dark.
    Then followed the Waldensian bands, whom Hate
    In vain endeavours to exterminate,
    Whom Obloquy pursues with hideous bark:
    But they desist not; and the sacred fire,
    Rekindled thus, from dens and savage woods                        
    Moves, handed on with never ceasing care,
    Through courts, through camps, o'er limitary floods;
    Nor lacks this sea girt Isle a timely share
    Of the new Flame, not suffered to expire.
