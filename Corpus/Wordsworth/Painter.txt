 All praise the Likeness by thy skill portrayed;
    But tis a fruitless task to paint for me,
    Who, yielding not to changes Time has made,
    By the habitual light of memory see
    Eyes unbedimmed, see bloom that cannot fade,                       
    And smiles that from their birth-place never shall flee
    Into the land where ghosts and phantoms be;
    And, seeing this, own nothing in its stead.
    Couldst thou go back into far-distant years,
    Or share with me, fond thought! that inward eye,
    Then, and then only, Painter! could thy Art
    The visual powers of Nature satisfy,
    Which hold, whateer to common sight appears,
    Their sovereign empire in a faithful heart.
