   Loud is the Vale! the Voice is up
    With which she speaks when storms are gone,
    A mighty unison of streams!
    Of all her Voices, One!

    Loud is the Vale;--this inland Depth                         
    In peace is roaring like the Sea;
    Yon star upon the mountain-top
    Is listening quietly.

    Sad was I, even to pain deprest,
    Importunate and heavy load!
    The Comforter hath found me here,
    Upon this lonely road;

    And many thousands now are sad--
    Wait the fulfilment of their fear;
    For he must die who is their stay,                          
    Their glory disappear.

    A Power is passing from the earth
    To breathless Nature's dark abyss;
    But when the great and good depart
    What is it more than this--                                 

    That Man, who is from God sent forth,
    Doth yet again to God return?--
    Such ebb and flow must ever be,
    Then wherefore should we mourn?
