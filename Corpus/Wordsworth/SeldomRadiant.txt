  Not seldom, clad in radiant vest,
    Deceitfully goes forth the Morn;
    Not seldom Evening in the west
    Sinks smilingly forsworn.

    The smoothest seas will sometimes prove,                       
    To the confiding Bark, untrue;
    And, if she trust the stars above,
    They can be treacherous too.

    The umbrageous Oak, in pomp outspread,
    Full oft, when storms the welkin rend,                        
    Draws lightning down upon the head
    It promised to defend.

    But Thou art true, incarnate Lord,
    Who didst vouchsafe for man to die;
    Thy smile is sure, thy plighted word                          
    No change can falsify!

    I bent before thy gracious throne,
    And asked for peace on suppliant knee;
    And peace was given,--nor peace alone,
    But faith sublimed to ecstasy!
