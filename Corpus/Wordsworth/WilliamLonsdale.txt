  Oft, through thy fair domains, illustrious Peer!
    In youth I roamed, on youthful pleasures bent;
    And mused in rocky cell or sylvan tent,
    Beside swift flowing Lowthers current clear.
    Now, by thy care befriended, I appear
    Before thee, LONSDALE, and this Work present,
    A token (may it prove a monument!)
    Of high respect and gratitude sincere.
    Gladly would I have waited till my task
    Had reached its close; but Life is insecure,
    And Hope full oft fallacious as a dream:
    Therefore, for what is here produced, I ask
    Thy favour; trusting that thou wilt not deem
    The offering, though imperfect, premature.
