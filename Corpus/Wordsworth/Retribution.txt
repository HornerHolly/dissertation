Fit retribution, by the moral code
    Determined, lies beyond the State embrace,
    Yet, as she may, for each peculiar case
    She plants well-measured terrors in the road
    Of wrongful acts. Downward it is and broad,                        
    And, the main fear once doomed to banishment,
    Far oftener then, bad ushering worse event,
    Blood would be spilt that in his dark abode
    Crime might lie better hid. And, should the change
    Take from the horror due to a foul deed,                          
    Pursuit and evidence so far must fail,
    And, guilt escaping, passion then might plead
    In angry spirits for her old free range,
    And the wild justice of revenge prevail.
