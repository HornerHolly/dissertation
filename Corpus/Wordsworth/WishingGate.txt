Hope rules a land for ever green:
    All powers that serve the brighteyed Queen
      Are confident and gay;
    Clouds at her bidding disappear;
    Points she to aught? the bliss draws near,                        
      And Fancy smooths the way.

    Not such the land of Wishes there
    Dwell fruitless daydreams, lawless prayer,
      And thoughts with things at strife;
    Yet how forlorn, should ye depart,                              
    Ye superstitions of the heart,
      How poor, were human life!

    When magic lore abjured its might,
    Ye did not forfeit one dear right,
      One tender claim abate;                                         
    Witness this symbol of your sway,
    Surviving near the public way,
      The rustic Wishinggate!

    Inquire not if the faery race
    Shed kindly influence on the place,                               
      Ere northward they retired;
    If here a warrior left a spell,
    Panting for glory as he fell;
      Or here a saint expired.

    Enough that all around is fair,                                   
    Composed with Nature's finest care,
      And in her fondest love
    Peace to embosom and content
    To overawe the turbulent,
      The selfish to reprove.                                         

    Yea! even the Stranger from afar,
    Reclining on this mossgrown bar,
      Unknowing, and unknown,
    The infection of the ground partakes,
    Longing for his Belovd who makes                                
      All happiness her own.

    Then why should conscious Spirits fear
    The mystic stirrings that are here,
      The ancient faith disclaim?
    The local Genius ne'er befriends                                  
    Desires whose course in folly ends,
      Whose just reward is shame.

    Smile if thou wilt, but not in scorn,
    If some, by ceaseless pains outworn,
      Here crave an easier lot;                                       
    If some have thirsted to renew
    A broken vow, or bind a true,
      With firmer, holier knot.

    And not in vain, when thoughts are cast
    Upon the irrevocable past,                                        
      Some Penitent sincere
    May for a worthier future sigh,
    While trickles from his downcast eye
      No unavailing tear.

    The Worldling, pining to be freed                                 
    From turmoil, who would turn or speed
      The current of his fate,
    Might stop before this favoured scene,
    At Nature's call, nor blush to lean
      Upon the Wishinggate.                                          

    The Sage, who feels how blind, how weak
    Is man, though loth such help to seek,
      Yet, passing, here might pause,
    And thirst for insight to allay
    Misgiving, while the crimson day                                  
      In quietness withdraws;

    Or when the churchclocks knell profound
    To Times first step across the bound
      Of midnight makes reply;
    Time pressing on with starry crest,                               
    To filial sleep upon the breast
      Of dread eternity.
