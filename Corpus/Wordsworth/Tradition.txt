 A love-lorn Maid, at some far-distant time,
    Came to this hidden pool, whose depths surpass
    In crystal clearness Dian's looking-glass;
    And, gazing, saw that Rose, which from the prime
    Derives its name, reflected as the chime                       
    Of echo doth reverberate some sweet sound:
    The starry treasure from the blue profound
    She longed to ravish;--shall she plunge, or climb
    The humid precipice, and seize the guest
    Of April, smiling high in upper air?                          
    Desperate alternative! what fiend could dare
    To prompt the thought?--Upon the steep rock's breast
    The lonely Primrose yet renews its bloom,
    Untouched memento of her hapless doom!
