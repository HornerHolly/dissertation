 Never enlivened with the liveliest ray
    That fosters growth or checks or cheers decay,
    Nor by the heaviest rain-drops more deprest,
    This Flower, that first appeared as summers guest,
    Preserves her beauty mid autumnal leaves                          
    And to her mournful habits fondly cleaves.

    When files of stateliest plants have ceased to bloom,
    One after one submitting to their doom,
    When her coevals each and all are fled,
    What keeps her thus reclined upon her lonesome bed?               

      The old mythologists, more impressd than we
    Of this late day by character in tree
    Or herb, that claimed peculiar sympathy,
    Or by the silent lapse of fountain clear,
    Or with the language of the viewless air                          
    By bird or beast made vocal, sought a cause
    To solve the mystery, not in Natures laws
    But in Mans fortunes. Hence a thousand tales
    Sung to the plaintive lyre in Grecian vales.
    Nor doubt that something of their spirit swayed                   
    The fancy-stricken Youth or heart-sick Maid,
    Who, while each stood companionless and eyed
    This undeparting Flower in crimson dyed,
    Thought of a wound which death is slow to cure,
    A fate that has endured and will endure,                          
    And, patience coveting yet passion feeding,
    Called the dejected Lingerer, _Love lies bleeding_.
