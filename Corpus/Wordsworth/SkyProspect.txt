  Lo! in the burning west, the craggy nape
    Of a proud Ararat! and, thereupon,
    The Ark, her melancholy voyage done!
    Yon rampant cloud mimics a lion's shape;
    There, combats a huge crocodile--agape                         
    A golden spear to swallow! and that brown
    And massy grove, so near yon blazing town,
    Stirs and recedes--destruction to escape!
    Yet all is harmless--as the Elysian shades
    Where Spirits dwell in undisturbed repose--                   
    Silently disappears, or quickly fades:
    Meek Nature's evening comment on the shows
    That for oblivion take their daily birth
    From all the fuming vanities of Earth!
