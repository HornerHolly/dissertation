  Tradition, be thou mute! Oblivion, throw
    Thy veil in mercy o'er the records, hung
    Round strath and mountain, stamped by the ancient tongue
    On rock and ruin darkening as we go,--
    Spots where a word, ghost-like, survives to show                   
    What crimes from hate, or desperate love, have sprung;
    From honour misconceived, or fancied wrong,
    What feuds, not quenched but fed by mutual woe.
    Yet, though a wild vindictive Race, untamed
    By civil arts and labours of the pen,                            
    Could gentleness be scorned by those fierce Men,
    Who, to spread wide the reverence they claimed
    For patriarchal occupations, named
    Yon towering Peaks, "Shepherds of Etive Glen?"
