    Intent on gathering wool from hedge and brake
    Yon busy Little-ones rejoice that soon
    A poor old Dame will bless them for the boon:
    Great is their glee while flake they add to flake
    With rival earnestness; far other strife                           
    Than will hereafter move them, if they make
    Pastime their idol, give their day of life
    To pleasure snatched for reckless pleasureâ€™s sake.
    Can pomp and show allay one heart-born grief?
    Pains which the World inflicts can she requite?                   
    Not for an interval however brief;
    The silent thoughts that search for stedfast light,
    Love from her depths, and Duty in her might,
    And Faith--these only yield secure relief.
