    A wing√®d Goddess clothed in vesture wrought
    Of rainbow colours; One whose port was bold,
    Whose overburthened hand could scarcely hold
    The glittering crowns and garlands which it brought
    Hovered in air above the far famed Spot.                       
    She vanished; leaving prospect blank and cold
    Of windswept corn that wide around us rolled
    In dreary billows, wood, and meagre cot,
    And monuments that soon must disappear:
    Yet a dread local recompense we found;                        
    While glory seemed betrayed, while patriot zeal
    Sank in our hearts, we felt as men should feel
    With such vast hoards of hidden carnage near,
    And horror breathing from the silent ground!
