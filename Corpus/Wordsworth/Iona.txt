  On to Iona!--What can she afford
    To _us_ save matter for a thoughtful sigh,
    Heaved over ruin with stability
    In urgent contrast? To diffuse the WORD
    (Thy Paramount, mighty Nature! and Time's Lord)
    Her Temples rose, 'mid pagan gloom; but why,                  
    Even for a moment, has our verse deplored
    Their wrongs, since they fulfilled their destiny?
    And when, subjected to a common doom
    Of mutability, those far-famed Piles                              
    Shall disappear from both the sister Isles,
    Iona's Saints, forgetting not past days,
    Garlands shall wear of amaranthine bloom,
    While heaven's vast sea of voices chants their praise
