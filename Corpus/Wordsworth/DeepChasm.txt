   From this deep chasm, where quivering sunbeams play
    Upon its loftiest crags, mine eyes behold
    A gloomy NICHE, capacious, blank, and cold;
    A concave free from shrubs and mosses grey;
    In semblance fresh, as if, with dire affray,                  
    Some Statue, placed amid these regions old
    For tutelary service, thence had rolled,
    Startling the flight of timid Yesterday!
    Was it by mortals sculptured?--weary slaves
    Of slow endeavour! or abruptly cast                           
    Into rude shape by fire, with roaring blast
    Tempestuously let loose from central caves?
    Or fashioned by the turbulence of waves,
    Then, when o'er highest hills the Deluge pass'd?
