Why should we weep or mourn, Angelic boy,
    For such thou wert ere from our sight removed,
    Holy, and ever dutiful--beloved
    From day to day with never-ceasing joy,
    And hopes as dear as could the heart employ                        
    In aught to earth pertaining? Death has proved
    His might, nor less his mercy, as behoved--
    Death conscious that he only could destroy
    The bodily frame. That beauty is laid low
    To moulder in a far-off field of Rome;                            
    But Heaven is now, blest Child, thy Spiritâ€™s home:
    When such divine communion, which we know,
    Is felt, thy Roman-burial place will be
    Surely a sweet remembrancer of Thee.
