 Along the mazes of this song I go
    As inward motions of the wandering thought
    Lead me, or outward circumstance impels.
    Thus do I urge a never-ending way
    Year after year, with many a sleep between,
    Through joy and sorrow; if my lot be joy
    More joyful if it be with sorrow soothâ€™d.
