 Yet many a Novice of the cloistral shade,
    And many chained by vows, with eager glee
    The warrant hail, exulting to be free;
    Like ships before whose keels, full long embayed
    In polar ice, propitious winds have made                           
    Unlooked-for outlet to an open sea,
    Their liquid world, for bold discovery,
    In all her quarters temptingly displayed!
    Hope guides the young; but when the old must pass
    The threshold, whither shall they turn to find                    
    The hospitality--the alms (alas!
    Alms may be needed) which that House bestowed?
    Can they, in faith and worship, train the mind
    To keep this new and questionable road?
