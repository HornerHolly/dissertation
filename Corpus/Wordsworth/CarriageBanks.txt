  Amid this dance of objects sadness steals
    O'er the defrauded heart--while sweeping by,
    As in a fit of Thespian jollity,
    Beneath her vine-leaf crown the green Earth reels:
    Backward, in rapid evanescence, wheels                         
    The venerable pageantry of Time,
    Each beetling rampart, and each tower sublime,
    And what the Dell unwillingly reveals
    Of lurking cloistral arch, through trees espied
    Near the bright River's edge. Yet why repine?                 
    To muse, to creep, to halt at will, to gaze--
    Such sweet way-faring--of life's spring the pride,
    Her summer's faithful joy--_that_ still is mine,
    And in fit measure cheers autumnal days.
