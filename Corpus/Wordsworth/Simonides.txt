I find it written of Simonides,
    That, travelling in strange countries, once he found
    A corpse that lay exposd upon the ground,
    For which, with palms, he causd due obsequies
    To be performd, and paid all holy fees.                           
    Soon after this man ghost unto him came,
    And told him not to sail, as was his aim,
    On board a ship then ready for the seas.
    Simonides, admonishd by the ghost,
    Remaind behind: the ship the following day                       
    Set sail, was wreckd, and all on board were lost.
    Thus was the tenderest Poet that could be,
    Who sang in antient Greece his loving lay,
    Savd out of many by his piety.
