 Desponding Father! mark this altered bough,
    So beautiful of late, with sunshine warmed,
    Or moist with dews; what more unsightly now,
    Its blossoms shrivelled, and its fruit, if formed,
    Invisible? yet Spring her genial brow                              
    Knits not o’er that discolouring and decay
    As false to expectation. Nor fret thou
    At like unlovely process in the May
    Of human life: a Stripling’s graces blow,
    Fade and are shed, that from their timely fall                    
    (Misdeem it not a cankerous change) may grow
    Rich mellow bearings, that for thanks shall call:
    In all men, sinful is it to be slow
    To hope----in Parents, sinful above all.
