 Closing the sacred Book which long has fed
    Our meditations, give we to a day
    Of annual joy one tributary lay;
    This day, when, forth by rustic music led,
    The village Children, while the sky is red                         
    With evening lights, advance in long array
    Through the still church-yard, each with garland gay,
    That, carried sceptre-like, o'ertops the head
    Of the proud Bearer. To the wide church-door,
    Charged with these offerings which their fathers bore             
    For decoration in the Papal time,
    The innocent Procession softly moves:--
    The spirit of Laud is pleased in heaven's pure clime,
    And Hooker's voice the spectacle approves!
