  The peace which others seek they find;
  The heaviest storms not longest last;
  Heaven grants even to the guiltiest mind
  An amnesty for what is past;
  When will my sentence be reversed?                           
  I only pray to know the worst;
  And wish as if my heart would burst.

  O weary struggle! silent years
  Tell seemingly no doubtful tale;
  And yet they leave it short, and fears                      
  And hopes are strong and will prevail.
  My calmest faith escapes not pain;
  And, feeling that the hope is vain,
  I think that he will come again.
