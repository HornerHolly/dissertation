Oft have I seen, ere Time had ploughed my cheek,
    Matrons and Sires--who, punctual to the call
    Of their loved Church, on fast or festival
    Through the long year the House of Prayer would seek:
    By Christmas snows, by visitation bleak                            
    Of Easter winds, unscared, from hut or hall
    They came to lowly bench or sculptured stall,
    But with one fervour of devotion meek.
    I see the places where they once were known,
    And ask, surrounded even by kneeling crowds,                      
    Is ancient Piety for ever flown?
    Alas! even then they seemed like fleecy clouds
    That, struggling through the western sky, have won
    Their pensive light from a departed sun!
