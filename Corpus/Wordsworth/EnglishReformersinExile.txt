 Scattering, like birds escaped the fowler's net,
    Some seek with timely flight a foreign strand;
    Most happy, re-assembled in a land
    By dauntless Luther freed, could they forget
    Their Country's woes. But scarcely have they met,                  
    Partners in faith, and brothers in distress,
    Free to pour forth their common thankfulness,
    Ere hope declines:--their union is beset
    With speculative notions rashly sown,                         
    Whence thickly-sprouting growth of poisonous weeds;
    Their forms are broken staves; their passions, steeds
    That master them. How enviably blest
    Is he who can, by help of grace, enthrone
    The peace of God within his single breast!
