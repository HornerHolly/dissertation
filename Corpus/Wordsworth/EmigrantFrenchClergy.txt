  Even while I speak, the sacred roofs of France
    Are shattered into dust; and self-exiled
    From altars threatened, levelled, or defiled,
    Wander the Ministers of God, as chance
    Opens a way for life, or consonance                                
    Of faith invites. More welcome to no land
    The fugitives than to the British strand,
    Where priest and layman with the vigilance
    Of true compassion greet them. Creed and test
    Vanish before the unreserved embrace                              
    Of catholic humanity:--distrest
    They came,--and, while the moral tempest roars
    Throughout the Country they have left, our shores
    Give to their Faith a fearless resting-place.
