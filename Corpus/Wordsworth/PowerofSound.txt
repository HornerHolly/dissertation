            

    Thy functions are ethereal,
    As if within thee dwelt a glancing mind,
    Organ of vision! And a Spirit aërial
    Informs the cell of Hearing, dark and blind;
    Intricate labyrinth, more dread for thought                        
    To enter than oracular cave;
    Strict passage, through which sighs are brought,
    And whispers for the heart, their slave;
    And shrieks, that revel in abuse
    Of shivering flesh; and warbled air,                              
    Whose piercing sweetness can unloose
    The chains of frenzy, or entice a smile
    Into the ambush of despair;
    Hosannas pealing down the long-drawn aisle,
    And requiems answered by the pulse that beats                     
    Devoutly, in life's last retreats!

    The headlong streams and fountains
    Serve Thee, invisible Spirit, with untired powers;
    Cheering the wakeful tent on Syrian mountains,
    They lull perchance ten thousand thousand flowers.                
    _That_ roar, the prowling lion's _Here I am_,
    How fearful to the desert wide!
    That bleat, how tender! of the dam
    Calling a straggler to her side.
    Shout, cuckoo!--let the vernal soul                               
    Go with thee to the frozen zone
    Toll from thy loftiest perch, lone bell-bird, toll!
    At the still hour to Mercy dear,
    Mercy from her twilight throne
    Listening to nun's faint throb of holy fear,                      
    To sailor's prayer breathed from a darkening sea,
    Or widow's cottage-lullaby.


    Ye Voices, and ye Shadows
    And Images of voice--to hound and horn
    From rocky steep and rock-bestudded meadows                       
    Flung back, and, in the sky's blue caves, reborn--
    On with your pastime! till the church-tower bells
    A greeting give of measured glee;
    And milder echoes from their cells
    Repeat the bridal symphony.                                       
    Then, or far earlier, let us rove
    Where mists are breaking up or gone,
    And from aloft look down into a cove
    Besprinkled with a careless quire,
    Happy milk-maids, one by one                                      
    Scattering a ditty each to her desire,
    A liquid concert matchless by nice Art,
    A stream as if from one full heart.

    Blest be the song that brightens
    The blind man's gloom, exalts the veteran's mirth;                
    Unscorned the peasant's whistling breath, that lightens
    His duteous toil of furrowing the green earth.
    For the tired slave, Song lifts the languid oar,
    And bids it aptly fall, with chime
    That beautifies the fairest shore,                               
    And mitigates the harshest clime.
    Yon pilgrims see--in lagging file
    They move; but soon the appointed way
    A choral _Ave Marie_ shall beguile,
    And to their hope the distant shrine                              
    Glisten with a livelier ray:
    Nor friendless he, the prisoner of the mine,
    Who from the well-spring of his own clear breast
    Can draw, and sing his griefs to rest.


    When civic renovation                                             
    Dawns on a kingdom, and for needful haste
    Best eloquence avails not, Inspiration
    Mounts with a tune, that travels like a blast
    Piping through cave and battlemented tower;
    Then starts the sluggard, pleased to meet                         
    That voice of Freedom, in its power
    Of promises, shrill, wild, and sweet!
    Who, from a martial _pageant_, spreads
    Incitements of a battle-day,                                     
    Thrilling the unweaponed crowd with plumeless heads?--
    Even She whose Lydian airs inspire
    Peaceful striving, gentle play
    Of timid hope and innocent desire
    Shot from the dancing Graces, as they move
    Fanned by the plausive wings of Love.                             
              
    How oft along thy mazes,
    Regent of sound, have dangerous Passions trod!
    O Thou, through whom the temple rings with praises,
    And blackening clouds in thunder speak of God,
    Betray not by the cozenage of sense
    Thy votaries, wooingly resigned
    To a voluptuous influence
    That taints the purer, better, mind;
    But lead sick Fancy to a harp
    That hath in noble tasks been tried;                              
    And, if the virtuous feel a pang too sharp,
    Soothe it into patience,--stay
    The uplifted arm of Suicide;
    And let some mood of thine in firm array
    Knit every thought the impending issue needs,                     
    Ere martyr burns, or patriot bleeds!


    As Conscience, to the centre
    Of being, smites with irresistible pain
    So shall a solemn cadence, if it enter
    The mouldy vaults of the dull idiot's brain,                  
    Transmute him to a wretch from quiet hurled--
    Convulsed as by a jarring din;
    And then aghast, as at the world
    Of reason partially let in
    By concords winding with a sway                             
    Terrible for sense and soul!
    Or, awed he weeps, struggling to quell dismay.
    Point not these mysteries to an Art
    Lodged above the starry pole;
    Pure modulations flowing from the heart                    
    Of divine Love, where Wisdom, Beauty, Truth
    With Order dwell, in endless youth?


    Oblivion may not cover
    All treasures hoarded by the miser, Time.
    Orphean Insight! truth's undaunted lover,              
    To the first leagues of tutored passion climb,
    When Music deigned within this grosser sphere
    Her subtle essence to enfold,
    And voice and shell drew forth a tear
    Softer than Nature's self could mould.                           
    Yet _strenuous_ was the infant Age:
    Art, daring because souls could feel,
    Stirred nowhere but an urgent equipage
    Of rapt imagination sped her march
    Through the realms of woe and weal:                            
    Hell to the lyre bowed low; the upper arch
    Rejoiced that clamorous spell and magic verse
    Her wan disasters could disperse.

                     

    The GIFT to king Amphion
    That walled a city with its melody                           
    Was for belief no dream:--thy skill, Arion!
    Could humanise the creatures of the sea,
    Where men were monsters.A last grace he craves,
    Leave for one chant;--the dulcet sound
    Steals from the deck o'er willing waves,                         
    And listening dolphins gather round.
    Self-cast, as with a desperate course,
    'Mid that strange audience, he bestrides
    A proud One docile as a managed horse;
    And singing, while the accordant hand                            
    Sweeps his harp, the Master rides;
    So shall he touch at length a friendly strand,
    And he, with his preserver, shine star-bright
    In memory, through silent night.

    The pipe of Pan, to shepherds                                    
    Couched in the shadow of Mænalian pines,
    Was passing sweet; the eyeballs of the leopards,
    That in high triumph drew the Lord of vines,
    How did they sparkle to the cymbal's clang!
    While Fauns and Satyrs beat the ground                           
    In cadence,--and Silenus swang
    This way and that, with wild-flowers crowned.
    To life, to _life_ give back thine ear:
    Ye who are longing to be rid
    Of fable, though to truth subservient, hear                      
    The little sprinkling of cold earth that fell
    Echoed from the coffin-lid;
    The convict's summons in the steeple's knell;
    "The vain distress-gun," from a leeward shore,
    Repeated-heard, and heard no more!                               
   

    For terror, joy, or pity,
    Vast is the compass and the swell of notes:
    From the babe's first cry to voice of regal city,
    Rolling a solemn sea-like bass, that floats
    Far as the woodlands--with the trill to blend                    
    Of that shy songstress, whose love-tale
    Might tempt an angel to descend,
    While hovering o'er the moonlight vale.
    Ye wandering Utterances, has earth no scheme,
    No scale of moral music--to unite                                
    Powers that survive but in the faintest dream
    Of memory?-O that ye might stoop to bear
    Chains, such precious chains of sight
    As laboured minstrelsies through ages wear!
    O for a balance fit the truth to tell                            
    Of the Unsubstantial, pondered well!

    By one pervading spirit
    Of tones and numbers all things are controlled,
    As sages taught, where faith was found to merit
    Initiation in that mystery old.
    The heavens, whose aspect makes our minds as still
    As they themselves appear to be,
    Innumerable voices fill
    With everlasting harmony;
    The towering headlands, crowned with mist,                      
    Their feet among the billows, know
    That Ocean is a mighty harmonist;
    Thy pinions, universal Air,
    Ever waving to and fro,
    Are delegates of harmony, and bear                               
    Strains that support the Seasons in their round;
    Stern Winter loves a dirge-like sound.

    Break forth into thanksgiving,
    Ye banded instruments of wind and chords;
    Unite, to magnify the Ever-living,
    Your inarticulate notes with the voice of words!
    Nor hushed be service from the lowing mead,
    Nor mute the forest hum of noon;
    Thou too be heard, lone eagle! freed
    From snowy peak and cloud, attune                           
    Thy hungry barkings to the hymn
    Of joy, that from her utmost walls
    The six-days' Work,by flaming Seraphim
    Transmits to Heaven! As Deep to Deep
    Shouting through one valley calls,                               
    All worlds, all natures, mood and measure keep
    For praise and ceaseless gratulation, poured
    Into the ear of God, their Lord!


    A Voice to Light gave Being;
    To Time, and Man his earth-born chronicler;              
    A Voice shall finish doubt and dim foreseeing,
    And sweep away life's visionary stir;
    The trumpet (we, intoxicate with pride,
    Arm at its blast for deadly wars)
    To archangelic lips applied,                                     
    The grave shall open, quench the stars.
    O Silence! are Man's noisy years
    No more than moments of thy life?
    Is Harmony, blest queen of smiles and tears,
    With her smooth tones and discords just,                         
    Tempered into rapturous strife,
    Thy destined bond-slave? No! though earth be dust
    And vanish, though the heavens dissolve, her stay
    Is in the WORD, that shall not pass away.
