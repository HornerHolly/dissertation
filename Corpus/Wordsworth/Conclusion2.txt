 If these brief Records, by the Muses' art
    Produced as lonely Nature or the strife
    That animates the scenes of public life
    Inspired, may in thy leisure claim a part;
    And if these Transcripts of the private heart                      
    Have gained a sanction from thy falling tears;
    Then I repent not. But my soul hath fears
    Breathed from eternity; for as a dart
    Cleaves the blank air, Life flies: now every day
    Is but a glimmering spoke in the swift wheel                      
    Of the revolving week. Away, away,
    All fitful cares, all transitory zeal!
    So timely Grace the immortal wing may heal,
    And honour rest upon the senseless clay.
