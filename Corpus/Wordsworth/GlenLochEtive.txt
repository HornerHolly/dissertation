 "This Land of Rainbows spanning glens whose walls,
    Rock-built, are hung with rainbow-coloured mists--
    Of far-stretched Meres whose salt flood never rests--
    Of tuneful Caves and playful Waterfalls--
    Of Mountains varying momently their crests--                       
    Proud be this Land! whose poorest huts are halls
    Where Fancy entertains becoming guests;
    While native song the heroic Past recals."
    Thus, in the net of her own wishes caught,
    The Muse exclaimed; but Story now must hide                       
    Her trophies, Fancy crouch; the course of pride
    Has been diverted, other lessons taught,
    That make the Patriot-spirit bow her head
    Where the all-conquering Roman feared to tread.
