 Once on the top of Tynwald's formal mound
    (Still marked with green turf circles narrowing
    Stage above stage)would sit this Island's King,
    The laws to promulgate, enrobed and crowned;
    While, compassing the little mount around,            
    Degrees and Orders stood, each under each:
    Now, like to things within fate's easiest reach,
    The power is merged, the pomp a grave has found.
    Off with yon cloud, old Snafell! that thine eye
    Over three Realms may take its widest range;                      
    And let, for them, thy fountains utter strange
    Voices, thy winds break forth in prophecy,
    If the whole State must suffer mortal change,
    Like Mona's miniature of sovereignty.
