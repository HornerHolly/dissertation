Pelion and Ossa flourish side by side,
  Together in immortal books enrolled:
  His ancient dower Olympus hath not sold;
  And that inspiring Hill, which "did divide
  Into two ample horns his forehead wide,"
  Shines with poetic radiance as of old;
  While not an English Mountain we behold
  By the celestial Muses glorified.
  Yet round our sea-girt shore they rise in crowds:
  What was the great Parnassus' self to Thee,                   
  Mount Skiddaw? In his natural sovereignty
  Our British Hill is nobler far; he shrouds
  His double front among Atlantic clouds, 
  And pours forth streams more sweet than Castaly.
