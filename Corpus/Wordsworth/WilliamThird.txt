 Calm as an undercurrent, strong to draw
    Millions of waves into itself, and run,
    From sea to sea, impervious to the sun
    And ploughing storm, the spirit of Nassau
    Swerves not, how blest if by religious awe
    Swayed, and thereby enabled to contend
    With the wide worlds commotions from its end
    Swerves not diverted by a casual law.
    Had mortal action eer a nobler scope?
    The Hero comes to liberate, not defy;                             
    And, while he marches on with stedfast hope,
    Conqueror beloved! expected anxiously!
    The vacillating Bondman of the Pope
    Shrinks from the verdict of his stedfast eye.
