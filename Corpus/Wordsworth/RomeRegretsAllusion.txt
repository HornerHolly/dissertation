 Those old credulities, to nature dear,
    Shall they no longer bloom upon the stock
    Of History, stript naked as a rock
    Mid a dry desert? What is it we hear?
    The glory of Infant Rome must disappear,
    Her morning splendours vanish, and their place
    Know them no more. If Truth, who veiled her face
    With those bright beams yet hid it not, must steer
    Henceforth a humbler course perplexed and slow;
    One solace yet remains for us who came                            
    Into this world in days when story lacked
    Severe research, that in our hearts we know
    How, for exciting youth heroic flame,
    Assent is power, belief the soul of fact.
