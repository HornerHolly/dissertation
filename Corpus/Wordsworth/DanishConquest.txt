Woe to the Crown that doth the Cowl obey!
    Dissension, checking arms that would restrain
    The incessant Rovers of the northern main,
    Helps to restore and spread a Pagan sway:
    But Gospel-truth is potent to allay                                
    Fierceness and rage; and soon the cruel Dane
    Feels, through the influence of her gentle reign,
    His native superstitions melt away.
    Thus, often, when thick gloom the east o'ershrouds,
    The full-orbed Moon, slow-climbing, doth appear                   
    Silently to consume the heavy clouds;
    _How_ no one can resolve; but every eye
    Around her sees, while air is hushed, a clear
    And widening circuit of ethereal sky.
