Throned in the Sun’s descending car,
    What Power unseen diffuses far
    This tenderness of mind?
    What Genius smiles on yonder flood?
    What God in whispers from the wood                                 
    Bids every thought be kind?

    O ever-pleasing solitude,
    Companion of the wise and good.

    Thy shades, thy silence, now be mine
      Thy charms my only theme;                                       

    Why haunt the hollow cliff whose Pine
      Waves o’er the gloomy stream;
    Whence the scared Owl on pinions grey
      Breaks from the rustling boughs,
    And down the lone vale sails away                                 
      To more profound repose!
