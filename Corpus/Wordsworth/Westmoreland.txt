 Seek who will delight in fable
    I shall tell you truth. A Lamb
    Leapt from this steep bank to follow
    Cross the brook its thoughtless dam.

    Far and wide on hill and valley                                    
    Rain had fallen, unceasing rain,
    And the bleating mother’s Young-one
    Struggled with the flood in vain:

    But, as chanced, a Cottage maiden
    (Ten years scarcely had she told)                                 
    Seeing, plunged into the torrent,
    Clasped the Lamb and kept her hold.
    Whirled adown the rocky channel,
    Sinking, rising, on they go,
    Peace and rest, as seems, before them                             
    Only in the lake below.

    Oh! it was a frightful current
    Whose fierce wrath the Girl had braved;
    Clap your hands with joy my Hearers,
    Shout in triumph, both are saved;                                

    Saved by courage that with danger
    Grew, by strength the gift of love,
    And belike a guardian angel
    Came with succour from above.

    Now, to a maturer Audience,                                       
    Let me speak of this brave Child
    Left among her native mountains
    With wild Nature to run wild.

    So, unwatched by love maternal,
    Mother’s care no more her guide,                                  
    Fared this little brighteyed Orphan
    Even while at her father’s side.

    Spare your blame, remembrance makes him
    Loth to rule by strict command;
    Still upon his cheek are living                                   
    Touches of her infant hand,

    Dear caresses given in pity,
    Sympathy that soothed his grief,
    As the dying mother witnessed
    To her thankful mind’s relief.                                    

    Time passed on; the Child was happy,
    Like a Spirit of air she moved,
    Wayward, yet by all who knew her
    For her tender heart beloved.

    Scarcely less than sacred passions,                               
    Bred in house, in grove, and field,
    Link her with the inferior creatures,
    Urge her powers their rights to shield.

    Anglers, bent on reckless pastime,
    Learn how she can feel alike                                      
    Both for tiny harmless minnow
    And the fierce and sharp-toothed pike.

    Merciful protectress, kindling
    Into anger or disdain;
    Many a captive hath she rescued,                                  
    Others saved from lingering pain.

    Listen yet awhile; with patience
    Hear the homely truths I tell,
    She in Grasmeres old churchsteeple
    Tolled this day the passingbell.                                 

    Yes, the wild Girl of the mountains
    To their echoes gave the sound,
    Notice punctual as the minute,
    Warning solemn and profound.

    She, fulfilling her sires office,                                
    Rang alone the far-heard knell,
    Tribute, by her hand, in sorrow,
    Paid to One who loved her well.

    When his spirit was departed
    On that service she went forth;                                   
    Nor will fail the like to render
    When his corse is laid in earth.

    What then wants the Child to temper,
    In her breast, unruly fire,
    To control the froward impulse                                    
    And restrain the vague desire?

    Easily a pious training
    And a stedfast outward power
    Would supplant the weeds and cherish,
    In their stead, each opening flower.                              

    Thus the fearless Lamb delivrer,
    Woman grown, meek hearted, sage,
    May become a blest example
    For her sex, of every age.

    Watchful as a wheeling eagle,                                     
    Constant as a soaring lark,
    Should the country need a heroine,
    She might prove our Maid of Arc.

    Leave that thought; and here be uttered
    Prayer that Grace divine may raise                                
    Her humane courageous spirit
    Up to heaven, thro peaceful ways.
