Now when the primrose makes a splendid show,
    And lilies face the March-winds in full blow,
    And humbler growths as moved with one desire
    Put on, to welcome spring, their best attire,
    Poor Robin is yet flowerless; but how gay                          
    With his red stalks upon this sunny day!
    And, as his tufts of leaves he spreads, content
    With a hard bed and scanty nourishment,
    Mixed with the green, some shine not lacking power
    To rival summer’s brightest scarlet flower;                       
    And flowers they well might seem to passers-by
    If looked at only with a careless eye;
    Flowers--or a richer produce (did it suit
    The season) sprinklings of ripe strawberry fruit.
    But while a thousand pleasures come unsought,                     
    Why fix upon his wealth or want a thought?
    Is the string touched in prelude to a lay
    Of pretty fancies that would round him play
    When all the world acknowledged elfin sway?
    Or does it suit our humour to commend                             
    Poor Robin as a sure and crafty friend,
    Whose practice teaches, spite of names to show
    Bright colours whether they deceive or no?--
    Nay, we would simply praise the free good-will
    With which, though slighted, he, on naked hill                    
    Or in warm valley, seeks his part to fill;
    Cheerful alike if bare of flowers as now,
    Or when his tiny gems shall deck his brow:
    Yet more, we wish that men by men despised,
    And such as lift their foreheads overprized,                      
    Should sometimes think, where’er they chance to spy
    This child of Nature’s own humility,
    What recompense is kept in store or left
    For all that seem neglected or bereft;
    With what nice care equivalents are given,                        
    How just, how bountiful, the hand of Heaven.
