 Stay, bold Adventurer; rest awhile thy limbs
    On this commodious Seat! for much remains
    Of hard ascent before thou reach the top
    Of this huge Eminence,--from blackness named,
    And, to far-travelled storms of sea and land,                
    A favourite spot of tournament and war!
    But thee may no such boisterous visitants
    Molest; may gentle breezes fan thy brow;
    And neither cloud conceal, nor misty air
    Bedim, the grand terraqueous spectacle,                     
    From centre to circumference, unveiled!
    Know, if thou grudge not to prolong thy rest,
    That on the summit whither thou art bound,
    A geographic Labourer pitched his tent,
    With books supplied and instruments of art,                 
    To measure height and distance; lonely task,
    Week after week pursued!--To him was given
    Full many a glimpse (but sparingly bestowed
    On timid man) of Nature's processes
    Upon the exalted hills. He made report                      
    That once, while there he plied his studious work
    Within that canvass Dwelling, colours, lines,
    And the whole surface of the out-spread map,
    Became invisible: for all around
    Had darkness fallen--unthreatened, unproclaimed--           
    As if the golden day itself had been
    Extinguished in a moment; total gloom,
    In which he sate alone, with unclosed eyes,
    Upon the blinded mountain's silent top!
