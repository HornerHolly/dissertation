How soon--alas! did Man, created pure--
    By Angels guarded, deviate from the line
    Prescribed to duty:--woeful forfeiture
    He made by wilful breach of law divine.
    With like perverseness did the Church abjure                       
    Obedience to her Lord, and haste to twine,
    'Mid Heaven-born flowers that shall for aye endure,
    Weeds on whose front the world had fixed her sign.
    O Man,--if with thy trials thus it fares,
    If good can smooth the way to evil choice,                        
    From all rash censure be the mind kept free;
    He only judges right who weighs, compares,
    And, in the sternest sentence which his voice
    Pronounces, ne'er abandons Charity.
