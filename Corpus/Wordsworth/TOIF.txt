  The star which comes at close of day to shine
    More heavenly bright than when it leads the morn,
    Is friendship’s emblem, whether the forlorn
    She visiteth, or, shedding light benign
    Through shades that solemnize Life’s calm decline,                 
    Doth make the happy happier. This have we
    Learnt, Isabel, from thy society,
    Which now we too unwillingly resign
    Though for brief absence. But farewell! the page
    Glimmers before my sight through thankful tears,                  
    Such as start forth, not seldom, to approve
    Our truth, when we, old yet unchill’d by age,
    Call thee, though known but for a few fleet years,
    The heart-affianced sister of our love!
