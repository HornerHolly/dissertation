 Said Secrecy to Cowardice and Fraud,
    Falsehood and Treachery, in close council met,
    Deep under ground, in Pluto cabinet,
    The frost of England pride will soon be thawed;
    Hooded the open brow that overawed                                 
    Our schemes; the faith and honour, never yet
    By us with hope encountered, be upset
    For once I burst my bands, and cry, applaud
    Then whispered she, The Bill is carrying out
    They heard, and, starting up, the Brood of Night                  
    Clapped hands, and shook with glee their matted locks;
    All Powers and Places that abhor the light
    Joined in the transport, echoed back their shout,
    Hurrah for hugging his Ballot-box
