 A GENIAL hearth, a hospitable board,
    And a refined rusticity, belong
    To the neat mansion, where, his flock among,
    The learned Pastor dwells, their watchful Lord.
    Though meek and patient as a sheath√®d sword;                       
    Though pride's least lurking thought appear a wrong
    To human kind; though peace be on his tongue,
    Gentleness in his heart--can earth afford
    Such genuine state, pre-eminence so free,
    As when, arrayed in Christ's authority,                           
    He from the pulpit lifts his awful hand;
    Conjures, implores, and labours all he can
    For re-subjecting to divine command
    The stubborn spirit of rebellious man?
