In my mind's eye a Temple, like a cloud
    Slowly surmounting some invidious hill,
    Rose out of darkness: the bright Work stood still;
    And might of its own beauty have been proud,
    But it was fashioned and to God was vowed                          
    By Virtues that diffused, in every part,
    Spirit divine through forms of human art:
    Faith had her arch--her arch, when winds blow loud,
    Into the consciousness of safety thrilled;
    And Love her towers of dread foundation laid                      
    Under the grave of things; Hope had her spire
    Star-high, and pointing still to something higher;
    Trembling I gazed, but heard a voice--it said,
    "Hell-gates are powerless Phantoms when _we_ build."
