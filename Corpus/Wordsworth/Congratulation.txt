Thus all things lead to Charity, secured
    By THEM who blessed the soft and happy gale
    That landward urged the great Deliverer's sail,
    Till in the sunny bay his fleet was moored!
    Propitious hour! had we, like them, endured                        
    Sore stress of apprehension, with a mind
    Sickened by injuries, dreading worse designed,
    From month to month trembling and unassured,
    How had we then rejoiced! But we have felt,
    As a loved substance, their futurity:                             
    Good, which they dared not hope for, we have seen;
    A State whose generous will through earth is dealt;
    A State--which, balancing herself between
    Licence and slavish order, dares be free.
