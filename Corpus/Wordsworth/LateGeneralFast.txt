Reluctant call it was; the rite delayed;
    And in the Senate some there were who doffed
    The last of their humanity, and scoffed
    At providential judgments, undismayed
    By their own daring. But the People prayed                         
    As with one voice; their flinty heart grew soft
    With penitential sorrow, and aloft
    Their spirit mounted, crying, "God us aid!"
    Oh that with aspirations more intense,
    Chastised by self-abasement more profound,                        
    This People, once so happy, so renowned
    For liberty, would seek from God defence
    Against far heavier ill, the pestilence
    Of revolution, impiously unbound!
