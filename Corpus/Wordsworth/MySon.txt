My Son! behold the tide already spent
    That rose, and steadily advanced to fill
    The shores and channels, working Natureâ€™s will
    Among the mazy streams that backward went,
    And in the sluggish Ports where ships were pent.                   
    And now, its task performed, the flood stands still
    At the green base of many an inland hill,
    In placid beauty and entire content.
    Such the repose that Sage and Hero find,
    Such measured rest the diligent and good                          
    Of humbler name, whose souls do like the flood
    Of ocean press right on, or gently wind,
    Neither to be diverted nor withstood
    Until they reach the bounds by Heaven assigned.
