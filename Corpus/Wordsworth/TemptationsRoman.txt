 Watch, and be firm! for, soul-subduing vice,
    Heart-killing luxury, on your steps await.
    Fair houses, baths, and banquets delicate,
    And temples flashing, bright as polar ice,
    Their radiance through the woods--may yet suffice                  
    To sap your hardy virtue, and abate
    Your love of Him upon whose forehead sate
    The crown of thorns; whose life-blood flowed, the price
    Of your redemption. Shun the insidious arts
    That Rome provides, less dreading from her frown                  
    Than from her wily praise, her peaceful gown,
    Language, and letters;--these, though fondly viewed
    As humanising graces, are but parts
    And instruments of deadliest servitude!
