 It is a beauteous evening, calm and free, 
  The holy time is quiet as a Nun
  Breathless with adoration; the broad sun
  Is sinking down in its tranquillity
  The gentleness of heaven broods over the Sea: 
  Listen the mighty Being is awake,
  And doth with his eternal motion make
  A sound like thunder everlastingly.
  Dear Child dear Girl that walkest with me here, 
  If thou appear untouched by solemn thought, 
  Thy nature is not therefore less divine:
  Thou liest in Abraham bosom all the year;
  And worshipp'st at the Temple inner shrine,
  God being with thee when we know it not.
