Desire we past illusions to recal?
    To reinstate wild Fancy, would we hide
    Truth whose thick veil Science has drawn aside?
    No,--let this Age, high as she may, instal
    In her esteem the thirst that wrought man's fall,                  
    The universe is infinitely wide;
    And conquering Reason, if self-glorified,
    Can nowhere move uncrossed by some new wall
    Or gulf of mystery, which thou alone,
    Imaginative Faith! canst overleap,                                
    In progress toward the fount of Love,--the throne
    Of Power whose ministers the records keep
    Of periods fixed, and laws established, less
    Flesh to exalt than prove its nothingness.
