  'Tis gone with old belief and dream
    That round it clung, and tempting scheme
      Released from fear and doubt;
    And the bright landscape too must lie,
    By this blank wall, from every eye,                                
      Relentlessly shut out.

    Bear witness ye who seldom passed
    That opening but a look ye cast
      Upon the lake below,
    What spirit stirring power it gained                              
    From faith which here was entertained,
      Though reason might say no.

    Blest is that ground, where, oer the springs
    Of history, Glory claps her wings,
      Fame sheds the exulting tear;                                   
    Yet earth is wide, and many a nook
    Unheard of is, like this, a book
      For modest meanings dear.

    It was in sooth a happy thought
    That grafted, on so fair a spot,                                  
      So confident a token
    Of coming good; the charm is fled;
    Indulgent centuries spun a thread,
      Which one harsh day has broken.

    Alas! for him who gave the word;                                  
    Could he no sympathy afford,
      Derived from earth or heaven,
    To hearts so oft by hope betrayed;
    Their very wishes wanted aid
      Which here was freely given?                                    

    Where, for the love-lorn maiden's wound,
    Will now so readily be found
      A balm of expectation?
    Anxious for far-off children, where
    Shall mothers breathe a like sweet air                            
      Of homefelt consolation?
    And not unfelt will prove the loss
    Mid trivial care and petty cross
      And each days shallow grief;
    Though the most easily beguiled                                   
    Were oft among the first that smiled
      At their own fond belief.

    If still the reckless change we mourn,
    A reconciling thought may turn
      To harm that might lurk here,                                   
    Ere judgment prompted from within
    Fit aims, with courage to begin,
      And strength to persevere.

    Not Fortunes slave is Man: our state
    Enjoins, while firm resolves await                                
      On wishes just and wise,
    That strenuous action follow both,
    And life be one perpetual growth
      Of heaven-ward enterprise.

    So taught, so trained, we boldly face                             
    All accidents of time and place;
      Whatever props may fail,
    Trust in that sovereign law can spread
    New glory oer the mountain's head,
      Fresh beauty through the vale.                                  

    That truth informing mind and heart,
    The simplest cottager may part,
      Ungrieved, with charm and spell;
    And yet, lost Wishinggate, to thee
    The voice of grateful memory                                      
      Shall bid a kind farewell!
