Patriots informed with Apostolic light
    Were they, who, when their Country had been freed,
    Bowing with reverence to the ancient creed,
    Fixed on the frame of England's Church their sight,
    And strove in filial love to reunite                               
    What force had severed. Thence they fetched the seed
    Of Christian unity, and won a meed
    Of praise from Heaven. To Thee, O saintly WHITE,
    Patriarch of a wide-spreading family,
    Remotest lands and unborn times shall turn,                      
    Whether they would restore or build--to Thee,
    As one who rightly taught how zeal should burn,
    As one who drew from out Faith's holiest urn
    The purest stream of patient Energy.
