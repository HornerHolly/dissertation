The gentlest Poet, with free thoughts endowed,
And a true master of the glowing strain,
Might scan the narrow province with disdain
That to the Painterâ€™s skill is here allowed.
This, this the Bird of Paradise! disclaim 5
The daring thought, forget the name;
This the Sun Bird, whom Glendoveers might own
As no unworthy Partner in their flight
Through seas of ether, where the ruffling sway
Of nether air rude billows is unknown
Whom Sylphs, if eer for casual pastime they
Through India spicy regions wing their way,
Might bow to as their Lord. What character,
O sovereign Nature! I appeal to thee,
Of all thy feathered progeny 
Is so unearthly, and what shape so fair?
So richly decked in variegated down,
Green, sable, shining yellow, shadowy brown,
Tints softly with each other blended,
Hues doubtfully begun and ended; 
Or intershooting, and to sight
Lost and recovered, as the rays of light
Glance on the conscious plumes touched here and there?
Full surely, when with such proud gifts of life
Began the pencil strife, 
Oerweening Art was caught as in a snare.
A sense of seemingly presumptuous wrong
Gave the first impulse to the Poet song;
But, of his scorn repenting soon, he drew
A juster judgment from a calmer view; 
And, with a spirit freed from discontent,
Thankfully took an effort that was meant
Not with God bounty, Nature love, to vie,

Or made with hope to please that inward eye
Which ever strives in vain itself to satisfy, 
But to recal the truth by some faint trace
Of power ethereal and celestial grace,
That in the living Creature find on earth a place.
