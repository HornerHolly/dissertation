  Driven in by Autumn's sharpening air
    From half-stripped woods and pastures bare,
    Brisk Robin seeks a kindlier home:
    Not like a beggar is he come,
    But enters as a looked-for guest,                                  
    Confiding in his ruddy breast,
    As if it were a natural shield
    Charged with a blazon on the field,
    Due to that good and pious deed
    Of which we in the Ballad read.                                   
    But pensive fancies putting by,
    And wild-wood sorrows, speedily
    He plays the expert ventriloquist;
    And, caught by glimpses now--now missed,
    Puzzles the listener with a doubt                                 
    If the soft voice he throws about
    Comes from within doors or without!
    Was ever such a sweet confusion,
    Sustained by delicate illusion?
    He's at your elbow--to your feeling                               
    The notes are from the floor or ceiling;
    And there's a riddle to be guessed,
    'Till you have marked his heaving chest,
    And busy throat whose sink and swell,
    Betray the Elf that loves to dwell                                
    In Robin's bosom, as a chosen cell.

      Heart-pleased we smile upon the Bird
    If seen, and with like pleasure stirred
    Commend him, when he's only heard.
    But small and fugitive our gain                                   
    Compared with _hers_who long hath lain,
    With languid limbs and patient head
    Reposing on a lone sick-bed;
    Where now, she daily hears a strain
    That cheats her of too busy cares,                          
    Eases her pain, and helps her prayers.
    And who but this dear Bird beguiled
    The fever of that pale-faced Child;
    Now cooling, with his passing wing,
    Her forehead, like a breeze of Spring:                            
    Recalling now, with descant soft
    Shed round her pillow from aloft,
    Sweet thoughts of angels hovering nigh,
    And the invisible sympathy
    Of "Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and John,                            
    Blessing the bed she lies upon?"
    And sometimes, just as listening ends
    In slumber, with the cadence blends
    A dream of that low-warbled hymn
    Which old folk, fondly pleased to trim                           
    Lamps of faith, now burning dim,
    Say that the Cherubs carved in stone,
    When clouds gave way at dead of night
    And the ancient church was filled with light,
    Used to sing in heavenly tone,                                    
    Above and round the sacred places
    They guard, with winged baby-faces.

      Thrice happy Creature! in all lands
    Nurtured by hospitable hands:
    Free entrance to this cot has he,                                 
    Entrance and exit both _yet_ free;
    And, when the keen unruffled weather
    That thus brings man and bird together,
    Shall with its pleasantness be past,
    And casement closed and door made fast,                           
    To keep at bay the howling blast,
    _He_ needs not fear the season's rage,
    For the whole house is Robin's cage.
    Whether the bird flit here or there,
    O'er table _lilt_, or perch on chair,                             
    Though some may frown and make a stir,
    To scare him as a trespasser,
    And he belike will flinch or start,
    Good friends he has to take his part;
    One chiefly, who with voice and look                              
    Pleads for him from the chimney-nook,
    Where sits the Dame, and wears away
    Her long and vacant holiday;
    With images about her heart,
    Reflected from the years gone by,                                 
    On human nature's second infancy.
