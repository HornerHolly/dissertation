    The old inventive Poets, had they seen,
    Or rather felt, the entrancement that detains
    Thy waters, Duddon! 'mid these flowery plains;
    The still repose, the liquid lapse serene,
    Transferred to bowers imperishably green,                      
    Had beautified Elysium! But these chains
    Will soon be broken;--a rough course remains,
    Rough as the past; where Thou, of placid mien,
    Innocuous as a firstling of the flock,
    And countenanced like a soft cerulean sky,                    
    Shalt change thy temper; and, with many a shock
    Given and received in mutual jeopardy,
    Dance, like a Bacchanal, from rock to rock,
    Tossing her frantic thyrsus wide and high!
