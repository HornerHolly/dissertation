The world forsaken, all its busy cares
    And stirring interests shunned with desperate flight,
    All trust abandoned in the healing might
    Of virtuous action; all that courage dares,
    Labour accomplishes, or patience bears--                           
    Those helps rejected, they, whose minds perceive
    How subtly works manâ€™s weakness, sighs may heave
    For such a One beset with cloistral snares.
    Father of Mercy! rectify his view,
    If with his vows this object ill agree;                           
    Shed over it thy grace, and thus subdue
    Imperious passion in a heart set free:--
    That earthly love may to herself be true,
    Give him a soul that cleaveth unto thee.
