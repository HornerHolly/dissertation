  With each recurrence of this glorious morn
    That saw the Saviour in his human frame
    Rise from the dead, erewhile the Cottage-dame
    Put on fresh raiment--till that hour unworn:
    Domestic hands the home-bred wool had shorn,              
    And she who span it culled the daintiest fleece,
    In thoughtful reverence to the Prince of Peace,
    Whose temples bled beneath the platted thorn.
    A blest estate when piety sublime
    These humble props disdained not! O green dales!
    Sad may _I_ be who heard your sabbath chime                   
    When Art's abused inventions were unknown;
    Kind Nature's various wealth was all your own;
    And benefits were weighed in Reason's scales!
