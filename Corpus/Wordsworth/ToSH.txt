Excuse is needless when with love sincere
    Of occupation, not by fashion led,
    Thou turn'st the Wheel that slept with dust o'erspread;
    _My_ nerves from no such murmur shrink,--tho' near,
    Soft as the Dorhawk's to a distant ear,                            
    When twilight shades darken the mountain's head.
    Even She who toils to spin our vital thread
    Might smile on work, O Lady, once so dear
    To household virtues. Venerable Art,
    Torn from the Poor! yet shall kind Heaven protect            
    Its own; though Rulers, with undue respect,
    Trusting to crowded factory and mart
    And proud discoveries of the intellect,
    Heed not the pillage of man's ancient heart.
