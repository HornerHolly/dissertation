 Outstretching flame-ward his upbraided hand
    (O God of mercy, may no earthly Seat
    Of judgment such presumptuous doom repeat!)
    Amid the shuddering throng doth Cranmer stand;
    Firm as the stake to which with iron band                          
    His frame is tied; firm from the naked feet
    To the bare head. The victory is complete;
    The shrouded Body to the Soul's command
    Answers with more than Indian fortitude,
    Through all her nerves with finer sense endued,                   
    Till breath departs in blissful aspiration:
    Then, 'mid the ghastly ruins of the fire,
    Behold the unalterable heart entire,
    Emblem of faith untouched, miraculous attestation!
