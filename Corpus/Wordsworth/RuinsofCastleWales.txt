 Through shattered galleries, 'mid roofless halls,
    Wandering with timid footsteps oft betrayed,
    The Stranger sighs, nor scruples to upbraid
    Old Time, though he, gentlest among the Thralls
    Of Destiny, upon these wounds hath laid                            
    His lenient touches, soft as light that falls,
    From the wan Moon, upon the towers and walls,
    Light deepening the profoundest sleep of shade.
    Relic of Kings! Wreck of forgotten wars,
    To winds abandoned and the prying stars,                          
    Time _loves_ Thee! at his call the Seasons twine
    Luxuriant wreaths around thy forehead hoar;
    And, though past pomp no changes can restore,
    A soothing recompense, his gift, is thine!
