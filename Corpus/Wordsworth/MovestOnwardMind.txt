 O Thou who movest onward with a mind
    Intent upon thy way, pause, though in haste!
    'Twill be no fruitless moment. I was born
    Within Savona's walls, of gentle blood.
    On Tiber's banks my youth was dedicate                       
    To sacred studies; and the Roman Shepherd
    Gave to my charge Urbino's numerous flock.
    Well did I watch, much laboured, nor had power
    To escape from many and strange indignities;
    Was smitten by the great ones of the world,                 
    But did not fall; for Virtue braves all shocks,
    Upon herself resting immoveably.
    Me did a kindlier fortune then invite
    To serve the glorious Henry, King of France,
    And in his hands I saw a high reward                        
    Stretched out for my acceptance,--but Death came.
    Now, Reader, learn from this my fate, how false,
    How treacherous to her promise, is the world;
    And trust in God--to whose eternal doom
    Must bend the sceptred Potentates of earth.
