 The captive Bird was gone;--to cliff or moor
    Perchance had flown, delivered by the storm;
    Or he had pined, and sunk to feed the worm:
    Him found we not: but, climbing a tall tower,
    There saw, impaved with rude fidelity                             
    Of art mosaic, in a roofless floor,
    An Eagle with stretched wings, but beamless eye--
    An Eagle that could neither wail nor soar.
    Effigy of the Vanished--(shall I dare
    To call thee so?) or symbol of fierce deeds                       
    And of the towering courage which past times
    Rejoiced in--take, whate'er thou be, a share,
    Not undeserved, of the memorial rhymes
    That animate my way where'er it leads!
