Forth rushed, from Envy sprung and Self-conceit,
    A Power misnamed the SPIRIT OF REFORM,
    And through the astonished Island swept in storm,
    Threatening to lay all Orders at her feet
    That crossed her way. Now stoops she to entreat                    
    Licence to hide at intervals her head,
    Where she may work, safe, undisquieted,
    In a close Box, covert for Justice meet.
    St. George of England! keep a watchful eye
    Fixed on the Suitor; frustrate her request--                      
    Stifle her hope; for, if the State comply,
    From such Pandorian gift may come a Pest
    Worse than the Dragon that bowed low his crest,
    Pierced by thy spear in glorious victory.
