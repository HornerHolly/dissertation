  Grief, thou hast lost an ever ready friend
    Now that the cottage Spinning-wheel is mute;
    And Care--a comforter that best could suit
    Her froward mood, and softliest reprehend;
    And Love--a charmer's voice, that used to lend,                
    More efficaciously than aught that flows
    From harp or lute, kind influence to compose
    The throbbing pulse--else troubled without end:
    Even Joy could tell, Joy craving truce and rest
    From her own overflow, what power sedate                      
    On those revolving motions did await
    Assiduously--to soothe her aching breast;
    And, to a point of just relief, abate
    The mantling triumphs of a day too blest.
