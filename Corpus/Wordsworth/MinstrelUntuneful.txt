"Why, Minstrel, these untuneful murmurings--
    Dull, flagging notes that with each other jar?"
    "Think, gentle Lady, of a Harp so far
    From its own country, and forgive the strings."
    A simple answer! but even so forth springs,                        
    From the Castalian fountain of the heart,
    The Poetry of Life, and all _that_ Art
    Divine of words quickening insensate things.
    From the submissive necks of guiltless men
    Stretched on the block, the glittering axe recoils;               
    Sun, moon, and stars, all struggle in the toils
    Of mortal sympathy; what wonder then
    That the poor Harp distempered music yields
    To its sad Lord, far from his native fields?
