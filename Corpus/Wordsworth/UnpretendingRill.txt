  There is a little unpretending Rill
    Of limpid water, humbler far than aught
    That ever among Men or Naiads sought
    Notice or name!--It quivers down the hill,
    Furrowing its shallow way with dubious will;                 
    Yet to my mind this scanty Stream is brought
    Oftener than Ganges or the Nile; a thought
    Of private recollection sweet and still!
    Months perish with their moons; year treads on year;
    But, faithful Emma! thou with me canst say                  
    That, while ten thousand pleasures disappear,
    And flies their memory fast almost as they,
    The immortal Spirit of one happy day
    Lingers beside that Rill, in vision clear.
