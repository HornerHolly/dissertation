 Arms and the Man I sing, the first who bore
    His course to Latium from the Trojan shore,
    A fugitive of fate. Long time was he
    By powers celestial tossed on land and sea
    Thro wrathful Juno far-famed enmity;
    Much too from war endured till new abodes
    He planted, and in Latium fixed his Gods,
    Whence flows the Latin people, whence have come
    The Alban Sites and walls of lofty Rome.
