 Son of my buried Son, while thus thy hand
    Is clasping mine, it saddens me to think
    How Want may press thee down, and with thee sink
    Thy Children left unfit, through vain demand
    Of culture, even to feel or understand                             
    My simplest Lay that to their memory
    May cling hard fate! which haply need not be
    Did Justice mould the Statutes of the Land.
    A Book time cherished and an honoured name
    Are high rewards; but bound they Nature claim                   
    Or Reason No hopes spun in timid line
    From out the bosom of a modest home
    Extend through unambitious years to come,
    My careless Little-one, for thee and thine
