Before the world had past her time of youth
    While polity and discipline were weak,
    The precept eye for eye, and tooth for tooth,
    Came forth a light, though but as of day-break,
    Strong as could then be borne. A Master meek                       
    Proscribed the spirit fostered by that rule,
    Patience his law, long-suffering his school,
    And love the end, which all through peace must seek.
    But lamentably do they err who strain
    His mandates, given rash impulse to controul                      
    And keep vindictive thirstings from the soul,
    So far that, if consistent in their scheme,
    They must forbid the State to inflict a pain,
    Making of social order a mere dream.
