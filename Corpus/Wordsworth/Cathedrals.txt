Open your gates, ye everlasting Piles!
    Types of the spiritual Church which God hath reared;
    Not loth we quit the newly-hallowed sward
    And humble altar, 'mid your sumptuous aisles
    To kneel, or thrid your intricate defiles,                         
    Or down the nave to pace in motion slow;
    Watching, with upward eye,the tall tower grow
    And mount, at every step, with living wiles
    Instinct--to rouse the heart and lead the will
    By a bright ladder to the world above.                            
    Open your gates, ye Monuments of love
    Divine! thou Lincoln, on thy sovereign hill!
    Thou, stately York! and Ye, whose splendours cheer
    Isis and Cam, to patient Science dear!
