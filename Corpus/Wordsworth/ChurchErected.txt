 Be this the chosen site; the virgin sod,
    Moistened from age to age by dewy eve,
    Shall disappear, and grateful earth receive
    The corner-stone from hands that build to God.
    Yon reverend hawthorns, hardened to the rod                       
    Of winter storms, yet budding cheerfully;
    Those forest oaks of Druid memory,
    Shall long survive, to shelter the Abode
    Of genuine Faith. Where, haply, 'mid this band
    Of daisies, shepherds sate of yore and wove                       
    May-garlands, there let the holy altar stand
    For kneeling adoration;--while--above,
    Broods, visibly portrayed, the mystic Dove,
    That shall protect from blasphemy the Land.
