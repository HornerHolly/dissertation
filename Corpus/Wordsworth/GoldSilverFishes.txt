  The soaring lark is blest as proud
      When at heaven's gate she sings;
    The roving bee proclaims aloud
      Her flight by vocal wings;
    While Ye, in lasting durance pent,                                
      Your silent lives employ
    For something more than dull content,
      Though haply less than joy.

    Yet might your glassy prison seem
      A place where joy is known,                                     
    Where golden flash and silver gleam
      Have meanings of their own;
    While, high and low, and all about,
      Your motions, glittering Elves!
    Ye weave--no danger from without,                                 
      And peace among yourselves.

    Type of a sunny human breast
      Is your transparent cell;
    Where Fear is but a transient guest,
      No sullen Humours dwell;                                        
    Where, sensitive of every ray
      That smites this tiny sea,
    Your scaly panoplies repay
      The loan with usury.

    How beautiful!--Yet none knows why                                
      This ever-graceful change,
    Renewed--renewed incessantly--
      Within your quiet range.
    Is it that ye with conscious skill
      For mutual pleasure glide;                                     
    And sometimes, not without your will,
      Are dwarfed, or magnified?

    Fays, Genii of gigantic size!
      And now, in twilight dim,
    Clustering like constellated eyes,                                
      In wings of Cherubim,
    When the fierce orbs abate their glare;--
      Whate'er your forms express,
    Whate'er ye seem, whate'er ye are--
      All leads to gentleness.                                        

    Cold though your nature be, 'tis pure;
      Your birthright is a fence
    From all that haughtier kinds endure
      Through tyranny of sense.
    Ah! not alone by colours bright                                   
      Are Ye to heaven allied,
    When, like essential Forms of light,
      Ye mingle, or divide.

    For day-dreams soft as e'er beguiled
      Day-thoughts while limbs repose;                               
    For moonlight fascinations mild,
      Your gift, ere shutters close--
    Accept, mute Captives! thanks and praise;
      And may this tribute prove
    That gentle admirations raise                                    
      Delight resembling love.
