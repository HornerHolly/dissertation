Not without heavy grief of heart did He
    On whom the duty fell (for at that time
    The father sojourned in a distant land)
    Deposit in the hollow of this tomb
    A brother's Child, most tenderly beloved!                    
    FRANCESCO was the name the Youth had borne,
    POZZOBONNELLI his illustrious house;
    And, when beneath this stone the Corse was laid,
    The eyes of all Savona streamed with tears.
    Alas! the twentieth April of his life                       
    Had scarcely flowered: and at this early time,
    By genuine virtue he inspired a hope
    That greatly cheered his country: to his kin
    He promised comfort; and the flattering thoughts
    His friends had in their fondness entertained,
    He suffered not to languish or decay.
    Now is there not good reason to break forth
    Into a passionate lament?--O Soul!
    Short while a Pilgrim in our nether world,
    Do thou enjoy the calm empyreal air;                        
    And round this earthly tomb let roses rise,
    An everlasting spring! in memory
    Of that delightful fragrance which was once
    From thy mild manners quietly exhaled.
