   Wait, prithee, wait this answer Lesbia threw
    Forth to her Dove, and took no further heed.
    Her eye was busy, while her fingers flew
    Across the harp, with soul engrossing speed;
    But from that bondage when her thoughts were freed                 
    She rose, and toward the close-shut casement drew,
    Whence the poor unregarded Favourite, true
    To old affections, had been heard to plead
    With flapping wing for entrance. What a shriek
    Forced from that voice so lately tuned to a strain                
    Of harmony a shriek of terror, pain,
    And self-reproach for, from aloft, a Kite
    Pounced and the Dove, which from its ruthless beak
    She could not rescue, perished in her sight
