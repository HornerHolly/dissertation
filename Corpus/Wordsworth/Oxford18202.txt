   Shame on this faithless heart! that could allow
    Such transport, though but for a moment's space;
    Not while--to aid the spirit of the place--
    The crescent moon clove with its glittering prow
    The clouds, or night-bird sang from shady bough;          
    But in plain daylight:--She, too, at my side,
    Who, with her heart's experience satisfied,
    Maintains inviolate its slightest vow!
    Sweet Fancy! other gifts must I receive;
    Proofs of a higher sovereignty I claim;                       
    Take from _her_ brow the withering flowers of eve,
    And to that brow life's morning wreath restore;
    Let _her_ be comprehended in the frame
    Of these illusions, or they please no more.
