Prompt transformation works the novel Lore;
    The Council closed, the Priest in full career
    Rides forth, an arm√®d man, and hurls a spear
    To desecrate the Fane which heretofore
    He served in folly. Woden falls, and Thor                          
    Is overturned: the mace, in battle heaved
    (So might they dream) till victory was achieved,
    Drops, and the God himself is seen no more.
    Temple and Altar sink, to hide their shame
    Amid oblivious weeds, "_O come to me,                               
    _Ye heavy laden!_" such the inviting voice
    Heard near fresh streams; and thousands, who rejoice
    In the new Rite--the pledge of sanctity,
    Shall, by regenerate life, the promise claim.
