  Where long and deeply hath been fixed the root
    In the blest soil of gospel truth, the Tree,
    Blighted or scathed tho many branches be,
    Put forth to wither, many a hopeful shoot
    Can never cease to bear celestial fruit.                           
    Witness the Church that oft times, with effect
    Dear to the saints, strives earnestly to eject
    Her bane, her vital energies recruit.
    Lamenting, do not hopelessly repine
    When such good work is doomed to be undone,
    The conquests lost that were so hardly won
    All promises vouchsafed by Heaven will shine
    In light confirmed while years their course shall run,
    Confirmed alike in progress and decline.
