Under the shadow of a stately Pile,
    The dome of Florence, pensive and alone,
    Nor giving heed to aught that passed the while,
    I stood, and gazed upon a marble stone,
    The laurelled Dante’s favourite seat. A throne,               
    In just esteem, it rivals; though no style
    Be there of decoration to beguile
    The mind, depressed by thought of greatness flown.
    As a true man, who long had served the lyre,
    I gazed with earnestness, and dared no more.                      
    But in his breast the mighty Poet bore
    A Patriot’s heart, warm with undying fire.
    Bold with the thought, in reverence I sate down,
    And, for a moment, filled that empty Throne.
