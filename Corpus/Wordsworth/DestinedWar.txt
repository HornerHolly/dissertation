   Destined to war from very infancy
    Was I, Roberto Dati, and I took
    In Malta the white symbol of the Cross:
    Nor in life's vigorous season did I shun
    Hazard or toil; among the sands was seen                     
    Of Libya; and not seldom, on the banks
    Of wide Hungarian Danube, 'twas my lot
    To hear the sanguinary trumpet sounded.
    So lived I, and repined not at such fate:
    This only grieves me, for it seems a wrong,                 
    That stripped of arms I to my end am brought
    On the soft down of my paternal home.
    Yet haply Arno shall be spared all cause
    To blush for me. Thou, loiter not nor halt
    In thy appointed way, and bear in mind                     
    How fleeting and how frail is human life!
