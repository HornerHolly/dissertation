Why cast ye back upon the Gallic shore,
    Ye furious waves! a patriotic Son
    Of England--who in hope her coast had won,
    His project crowned, his pleasant travel o'er?
    Well--let him pace this noted beach once more,                 
    That gave the Roman his triumphal shells;
    That saw the Corsican his cap and bells
    Haughtily shake, a dreaming Conqueror!--
    Enough: my Country's cliffs I can behold,
    And proudly think, beside the chafing sea,
    Of checked ambition, tyranny controlled,
    And folly cursed with endless memory:
    These local recollections ne'er can cloy;
    Such ground I from my very heart enjoy!
