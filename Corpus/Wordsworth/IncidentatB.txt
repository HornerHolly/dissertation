 In Brug√®s town is many a street
      Whence busy life hath fled;
    Where, without hurry, noiseless feet,
      The grass-grown pavement tread.
    There heard we, halting in the shade                               
      Flung from a Convent-tower,
    A harp that tuneful prelude made
      To a voice of thrilling power.

    The measure, simple truth to tell,
      Was fit for some gay throng;                                    
    Though from the same grim turret fell
      The shadow and the song.
    When silent were both voice and chords,
      The strain seemed doubly dear,
    Yet sad as sweet,--for _English_ words                           
      Had fallen upon the ear.

    It was a breezy hour of eve;
      And pinnacle and spire
    Quivered and seemed almost to heave,
      Clothed with innocuous fire;                                    
    But, where we stood, the setting sun
      Showed little of his state;
    And, if the glory reached the Nun,
      'Twas through an iron grate.

    Not always is the heart unwise
      Nor pity idly born,
    If even a passing Stranger sighs
      For them who do not mourn.
    Sad is thy doom, self-solaced dove,
      Captive, whoe'er thou be!
    Oh! what is beauty, what is love,
      And opening life to thee?

    Such feeling pressed upon my soul,
      A feeling sanctified
    By one soft trickling tear that stole                             
      From the Maiden at my side;
    Less tribute could she pay than this,
      Borne gaily o'er the sea,
    Fresh from the beauty and the bliss
      Of English liberty?
