 Who comes--with rapture greeted, and caress'd
    With frantic love--his kingdom to regain?
    Him Virtue's Nurse, Adversity, in vain
    Received, and fostered in her iron breast:
    For all she taught of hardiest and of best,                        
    Or would have taught, by discipline of pain
    And long privation, now dissolves amain,
    Or is remembered only to give zest
    To wantonness--Away, Circean revels!
    But for what gain? if England soon must sink                      
    Into a gulf which all distinction levels--
    That bigotry may swallow the good name,
    And, with that draught, the life-blood: misery, shame,
    By Poets loathed; from which Historians shrink!
