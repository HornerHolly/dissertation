    The Bard whose soul is meek as dawning day,
    Yet trained to judgments righteously severe,
    Fervid, yet conversant with holy fear,
    As recognising one Almighty sway
    He whose experienced eye can pierce the array                 
    Of past events to whom, in vision clear,
    The aspiring heads of future things appear,
    Like mountain tops whose mists have rolled away
    Assoiled from all encumbrance of our time,
    He only, if such breathe, in strains devout                   
    Shall comprehend this victory sublime;
    Shall worthily rehearse the hideous rout,
    The triumph hail, which from their peaceful clime
    Angels might welcome with a choral shout
