    "Beloved Vale!" I said, "when I shall con
    Those many records of my childish years,
    Remembrance of myself and of my peers
    Will press me down: to think of what is gone
    Will be an awful thought, if life have one."                 
    But, when into the Vale I came, no fears
    Distressed me; from mine eyes escaped no tears;
    Deep thought, or dread remembrance, had I none.
    By doubts and thousand petty fancies crost
    I stood, of simple shame the blushing Thrall;
    So narrow seemed the brooks, the fields so small!
    A Juggler's balls old Time about him tossed;
    I looked, I stared, I smiled, I laughed; and all
    The weight of sadness was in wonder lost.
