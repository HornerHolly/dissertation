 Said red-ribboned Evans:
    My legions in Spain
    Were at sixes and sevens;
    Now theyâ€™re famished or slain:
    But no fault of mine,                                              
    For, like brave Philip Sidney,
    In campaigning I shine,
    A true knight of his kidney.
    Sound flogging and fighting
    No chief, on my troth,                                            
    Ever took such delight in
    As I in them both.
    Fontarabbia can tell
    How my eyes watched the foe,
    Hernani knows well                                                
    That our feet were not slow;
    Our hospitals, too,
    They are matchless in story;
    Where her thousands Fate slew,
    All panting for glory                                         
    Alas for this Hero!
    His fame touched the skies,
    Then fell below zero,
    Never, never to rise!
    For him to Westminster                                            
    Did Prudence convey,
    There safe as a Spinster
    The Patriot to play.
    But why be so glad on
    His feats or his fall?                                            
    He got his red ribbon,
    And laughs at us all.
