If thou indeed derive thy light from Heaven,
    Then, to the measure of that heaven-born light,
    Shine, Poet! in thy place, and be content:--
    The stars pre-eminent in magnitude,
    And they that from the zenith dart their beams,  
    (Visible though they be to half the earth,
    Though half a sphere be conscious of their brightness)
    Are yet of no diviner origin,
    No purer essence, than the one that burns,
    Like an untended watch-fire, on the ridge                         
    Of some dark mountain; or than those which seem
    Humbly to hang, like twinkling winter lamps,
    Among the branches of the leafless trees;
    All are the undying offspring of one Sire:
    Then, to the measure of the light vouchsafed,                     
    Shine, Poet! in thy place, and be content.
