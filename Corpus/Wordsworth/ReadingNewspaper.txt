 "People! your chains are severing link by link;
    Soon shall the Rich be levelled down--the Poor
    Meet them half-way." Vain boast! for These, the more
    They thus would rise, must low and lower sink
    Till, by repentance stung, they fear to think;                     
    While all lie prostrate, save the tyrant few
    Bent in quick turns each other to undo,
    And mix the poison they themselves must drink.
    Mistrust thyself, vain Country! cease to cry,
    "Knowledge will save me from the threatened woe."
    For, if than other rash ones more thou know,                      
    Yet on presumptuous wing as far would fly
    Above thy knowledge as they dared to go,
    Thou wilt provoke a heavier penalty.
