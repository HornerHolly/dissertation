 They dreamt not of a perishable home
    Who thus could build. Be mine, in hours of fear
    Or grovelling thought, to seek a refuge here;
    Or through the aisles of Westminster to roam;
    Where bubbles burst, and folly's dancing foam                      
    Melts, if it cross the threshold; where the wreath
    Of awe-struck wisdom droops: or let my path
    Lead to that younger Pile, whose sky-like dome
    Hath typified by reach of daring art
    Infinity's embrace; whose guardian crest,                         
    The silent Cross, among the stars shall spread
    As now, when She hath also seen her breast
    Filled with mementos, satiate with its part
    Of grateful England's overflowing Dead.
