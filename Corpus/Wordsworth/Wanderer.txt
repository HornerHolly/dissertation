Twas summer, and the sun had mounted high:
    Southward the landscape indistinctly glared
    Through a pale steam; but all the northern downs,
    In clearest air ascending, showed far off
    A surface dappled oer with shadows flung                      
    From brooding clouds; shadows that lay in spots
    Determined and unmoved, with steady beams
    Of bright and pleasant sunshine interposed;
    To him most pleasant who on soft cool moss
    Extends his careless limbs along the front                    
    Of some huge cave, whose rocky ceiling casts
    A twilight of its own, an ample shade,
    Where the wren warbles, while the dreaming man,
    Half conscious of the soothing melody,
    With side long eye looks out upon the scene,
    By power of that impending covert, thrown,
    To finer distance. Mine was at that hour
    Far other lot, yet with good hope that soon
    Under a shade as grateful I should find
    Rest, and be welcomed there to livelier joy.
    Across a bare wide Common I was toiling
    With languid steps that by the slippery turf
    Were baffled; nor could my weak arm disperse
    The host of insects gathering round my face,
    And ever with me as I paced along.

      Upon that open moorland stood a grove,
    The wished for port to which my course was bound.
    Thither I came, and there, amid the gloom
    Spread by a brotherhood of lofty elms,
    Appeared a roofless Hut; four naked walls                     
    That stared upon each other! I looked round,
    And to my wish and to my hope espied
    The Friend I sought; a Man of reverend age,
    But stout and hale, for travel unimpaired.
    There was he seen upon the cottage bench,                    
    Recumbent in the shade, as if asleep;
    An iron pointed staff lay at his side.

      Him had I marked the day before alone
    And stationed in the public way, with face
    Turned toward the sun then setting, while that staff
    Afforded, to the figure of the man
    Detained for contemplation or repose,
    Graceful support; his countenance as he stood
    Was hidden from my view, and he remained
    Unrecognised; but, stricken by the sight,                    
    With slackened footsteps I advanced, and soon
    A glad congratulation we exchanged
    At such unthought of meeting. For the night
    We parted, nothing willingly; and now
    He by appointment waited for me here,                        
    Under the covert of these clustering elms.

      We were tried Friends: amid a pleasant vale,
    In the antique market village where was passed
    My school time, an apartment he had owned,
    To which at intervals the Wanderer drew,
    And found a kind of home or harbour there.
    He loved me; from a swarm of rosy boys
    Singled out me, as he in sport would say,
    For my grave looks, too thoughtful for my years.
    As I grew up, it was my best delight                         
    To be his chosen comrade. Many a time,
    On holidays, we rambled through the woods:
    We sate we walked; he pleased me with report
    Of things which he had seen; and often touched
    Abstrusest matter, reasonings of the mind                    
    Turned inward; or at my request would sing
    Old songs, the product of his native hills;
    A skilful distribution of sweet sounds,
    Feeding the soul, and eagerly imbibed
    As cool refreshing water, by the care                         
    Of the industrious husbandman, diffused
    Through a parched meadow-ground, in time of drought.
    Still deeper welcome found his pure discourse:
    How precious when in riper days I learned
    To weigh with care his words, and to rejoice                  
    In the plain presence of his dignity!

      Oh! many are the Poets that are sown
    By Nature; men endowed with highest gifts,
    The vision and the faculty divine;
    Yet wanting the accomplishment of verse,                      
    Which, in the docile season of their youth,
    It was denied them to acquire, through lack
    Of culture and the inspiring aid of books,
    Or haply by a temper too severe,
    Or a nice backwardness afraid of shame                      
    Nor having eer, as life advanced, been led
    By circumstance to take unto the height
    The measure of themselves, these favoured Beings,
    All but a scattered few, live out their time,
    Husbanding that which they possess within,                    
    And go to the grave, unthought of. Strongest minds
    Are often those of whom the noisy world
    Hears least; else surely this Man had not left
    His graces unrevealed and unproclaimed.
    But, as the mind was filled with inward light,
    So not without distinction had he lived,
    Beloved and honoured far as he was known.
    And some small portion of his eloquent speech,
    And something that may serve to set in view
    The feeling pleasures of his loneliness,                     
    His observations, and the thoughts his mind
    Had dealt with I will here record in verse;
    Which, if with truth it correspond, and sink
    Or rise as venerable Nature leads,
    The high and tender Muses shall accept                       
    With gracious smile, deliberately pleased,
    And listening Time reward with sacred praise.

      Among the hills of Athol he was born;
    Where, on a small hereditary farm,
    An unproductive slip of rugged ground,                       
    His Parents, with their numerous offspring, dwelt;
    A virtuous household, though exceeding poor!
    Pure livers were they all, austere and grave,
    And fearing God; the very children taught
    Stern self respect, a reverence for Gods word,              
    And an habitual piety, maintained
    With strictness scarcely known on English ground.

      From his sixth year, the Boy of whom I speak,
    In summer, tended cattle on the hills;
    But, through the inclement and the perilous days             
    Of long continuing winter, he repaired,
    Equipped with satchel, to a school, that stood
    Sole building on a mountains dreary edge,
    Remote from view of city spire, or sound
    Of minster clock! From that bleak tenement                   
    He, many an evening, to his distant home
    In solitude returning, saw the hills
    Grow larger in the darkness; all alone
    Beheld the stars come out above his head,
    And travelled through the wood, with no one near
    To whom he might confess the things he saw.                  

      So the foundations of his mind were laid.
    In such communion, not from terror free,
    While yet a child, and long before his time,
    Had he perceived the presence and the power              
    Of greatness; and deep feelings had impressed
    So vividly great objects that they lay
    Upon his mind like substances, whose presence
    Perplexed the bodily sense. He had received
    A precious gift; for, as he grew in years,               
    With these impressions would he still compare
    All his remembrances, thoughts, shapes, and forms;
    And, being still unsatisfied with aught
    Of dimmer character, he thence attained
    An active power to fasten images                             
    Upon his brain; and on their pictured lines
    Intensely brooded, even till they acquired
    The liveliness of dreams. Nor did he fail,
    While yet a child, with a childs eagerness
    Incessantly to turn his ear and eye                          
    On all things which the moving seasons brought
    To feed such appetite nor this alone
    Appeased his yearning: in the after day
    Of boyhood, many an hour in caves forlorn,
    And mid the hollow depths of naked crags                    
    He sate, and even in their fixed lineaments,
    Or from the power of a peculiar eye,
    Or by creative feeling overborne,
    Or by predominance of thought oppressed,
    Even in their fixed and steady lineaments                    
    He traced an ebbing and a flowing mind,
    Expression ever varying!
                             Thus informed,
    He had small need of books; for many a tale
    Traditionary, round the mountains hung,
    And many a legend, peopling the dark woods,                  
    Nourished Imagination in her growth,
    And gave the Mind that apprehensive power
    By which she is made quick to recognise
    The moral properties and scope of things.
    But eagerly he read, and read again,                         
    Whateer the ministers old shelf supplied;
    The life and death of martyrs, who sustained,
    With will inflexible, those fearful pangs
    Triumphantly displayed in records left
    Of persecution, and the Covenant times                      
    Whose echo rings through Scotland to this hour!
    And there, by lucky hap, had been preserved
    A straggling volume, torn and incomplete,
    That left half told the preternatural tale,
    Romance of giants, chronicle of fiends,                      
    Profuse in garniture of wooden cuts
    Strange and uncouth; dire faces, figures dire,
    Sharp kneed, sharp elbowed, and lean ankled too,
    With long and ghostly shanks forms which once seen
    Could never be forgotten!
                               In his heart,                     
    Where Fear sate thus, a cherished visitant,
    Was wanting yet the pure delight of love
    By sound diffused, or by the breathing air,
    Or by the silent looks of happy things,
    Or flowing from the universal face                          
    Of earth and sky. But he had felt the power
    Of Nature, and already was prepared,
    By his intense conceptions, to receive
    Deeply the lesson deep of love which he,
    Whom Nature, by whatever means, has taught                   
    To feel intensely, cannot but receive.

      Such was the Boy but for the growing Youth
    What soul was his, when, from the naked top
    Of some bold headland, he beheld the sun
    Rise up, and bathe the world in light! He looked
    Ocean and earth, the solid frame of earth                    
    And ocean's liquid mass, in gladness lay
    Beneath him: Far and wide the clouds were touched,
    And in their silent faces could he read
    Unutterable love. Sound needed none,                         
    Nor any voice of joy; his spirit drank
    The spectacle: sensation, soul, and form.
    All melted into him; they swallowed up
    His animal being; in them did he live,
    And by them did he live; they were his life.                 
    In such access of mind, in such high hour
    Of visitation from the living God,
    Thought was not; in enjoyment it expired.
    No thanks he breathed, he proffered no request;
    Rapt into still communion that transcends                    
    The imperfect offices of prayer and praise,
    His mind was a thanksgiving to the power
    That made him; it was blessedness and love!

      A Herdsman on the lonely mountain tops,
    Such intercourse was his, and in this sort                   
    Was his existence oftentimes possessed.
    O then how beautiful, how bright, appeared
    The written promise! Early had he learned
    To reverence the volume that displays
    The mystery, the life which cannot die;                      
    But in the mountains did he feel his faith.
    All things, responsive to the writing, there
    Breathed immortality, revolving life,
    And greatness still revolving; infinite:
    There littleness was not; the least of things                
    Seemed infinite; and there his spirit shaped
    Her prospects, nor did he believe, he saw.
    What wonder if his being thus became
    Sublime and comprehensive! Low desires,
    Low thoughts had there no place; yet was his heart
    Lowly; for he was meek in gratitude,                         
    Oft as he called those ecstasies to mind,
    And whence they flowed; and from them he acquired
    Wisdom, which works thro' patience; thence he learned
    In oft recurring hours of sober thought                  
    To look on Nature with a humble heart,
    Self questioned where it did not understand,
    And with a superstitious eye of love.

    So passed the time; yet to the nearest town
    He duly went with what small overplus                        
    His earnings might supply, and brought away
    The book that most had tempted his desires
    While at the stall he read. Among the hills
    He gazed upon that mighty orb of song,
    The divine Milton Lore of different kind,               
    The annual savings of a toilsome life,
    His School master supplied; books that explain
    The purer elements of truth involved
    In lines and numbers, and, by charm severe,
    (Especially perceived where nature droops                    
    And feeling is suppressed) preserve the mind
    Busy in solitude and poverty.
    These occupations oftentimes deceived
    The listless hours, while in the hollow vale,
    Hollow and green, he lay on the green turf                   
    In pensive idleness. What could he do,
    Thus daily thirsting, in that lonesome life
    With blind endeavours? Yet, still uppermost,
    Nature was at his heart as if he felt,
    Though yet he knew not how, a wasting power                  
    In all things that from her sweet influence
    Might tend to wean him. Therefore with her hues,
    Her forms, and with the spirit of her forms,
    He clothed the nakedness of austere truth.
    While yet he lingered in the rudiments                       
    Of science, and among her simplest laws,
    His triangles they were the stars of heaven,
    The silent stars! Oft did he take delight
    To measure the altitude of some tall crag
    That is the eagle's birth place, or some peak            
    Familiar with forgotten years, that shows
    Inscribed upon its visionary sides,
    The history of many a winter storm,
    Or obscure records of the path of fire.

      And thus before his eighteenth year was told,              
    Accumulated feelings pressed his heart
    With still increasing weight; he was o'erpowered
    By Nature; by the turbulence subdued
    Of his own mind; by mystery and hope,
    And the first virgin passion of a soul                       
    Communing with the glorious universe.
    Full often wished he that the winds might rage
    When they were silent: far more fondly now
    Than in his earlier season did he love
    Tempestuous nights the conflict and the sounds              
    That live in darkness. From his intellect
    And from the stillness of abstracted thought
    He asked repose; and, failing oft to win
    The peace required, he scanned the laws of light
    Amid the roar of torrents, where they send                   
    From hollow clefts up to the clearer air
    A cloud of mist, that smitten by the sun
    Varies its rainbow hues. But vainly thus,
    And vainly by all other means, he strove
    To mitigate the fever of his heart.                          

      In dreams, in study, and in ardent thought,
    Thus was he reared; much wanting to assist
    The growth of intellect, yet gaining more,
    And every moral feeling of his soul
    Strengthened and braced, by breathing in content             
    The keen, the wholesome, air of poverty,
    And drinking from the well of homely life.
    But, from past liberty, and tried restraints,
    He now was summoned to select the course
    Of humble industry that promised best                    
    To yield him no unworthy maintenance.
    Urged by his Mother, he essayed to teach
    A village school but wandering thoughts were then
    A misery to him; and the Youth resigned
    A task he was unable to perform.                             

      That stern yet kindly Spirit, who constrains
    The Savoyard to quit his naked rocks,
    The free born Swiss to leave his narrow vales,
    (Spirit attached to regions mountainous
    Like their own stedfast clouds) did now impel                
    His restless mind to look abroad with hope.
    An irksome drudgery seems it to plod on,
    Through hot and dusty ways, or pelting storm,
    A vagrant Merchant under a heavy load,
    Bent as he moves, and needing frequent rest;
    Yet do such travellers find their own delight;
    And their hard service, deemed debasing now,
    Gained merited respect in simpler times;
    When squire, and priest, and they who round them dwelt
    In rustic sequestration all dependent                      
    Upon the PEDLARS toil supplied their wants,
    Or pleased their fancies, with the wares he brought.
    Not ignorant was the Youth that still no few
    Of his adventurous countrymen were led
    By perseverance in this track of life                        
    To competence and ease to him it offered
    Attractions manifold; and this he chose.
    His Parents on the enterprise bestowed
    Their farewell benediction, but with hearts
    Foreboding evil. From his native hills                       
    He wandered far; much did he see of men
    Their manners, their enjoyments, and pursuits,
    Their passions and their feelings; chiefly those
    Essential and eternal in the heart,
    That, mid the simpler forms of rural life,              
    Exist more simple in their elements,
    And speak a plainer language. In the woods,
    A lone Enthusiast, and among the fields,
    Itinerant in this labour, he had passed
    The better portion of his time; and there                    
    Spontaneously had his affections thriven
    Amid the bounties of the year, the peace
    And liberty of nature there he kept
    In solitude and solitary thought
    His mind in a just equipoise of love.                        
    Serene it was, unclouded by the cares
    Of ordinary life; unvexed, unwarped
    By partial bondage. In his steady course,
    No piteous revolutions had he felt,
    No wild varieties of joy and grief.                          
    Unoccupied by sorrow of its own,
    His heart lay open; and, by nature tuned
    And constant disposition of his thoughts
    To sympathy with man, he was alive
    To all that was enjoyed whereer he went,                    
    And all that was endured; for, in himself
    Happy, and quiet in his cheerfulness,
    He had no painful pressure from without
    That made him turn aside from wretchedness
    With coward fears. He could afford to suffer               
    With those whom he saw suffer. Hence it came
    That in our best experience he was rich,
    And in the wisdom of our daily life.
    For hence, minutely, in his various rounds,
    He had observed the progress and decay                       
    Of many minds, of minds and bodies too;
    The history of many families;
    How they had prospered; how they were oerthrown
    By passion or mischance, or such misrule
    Among the unthinking masters of the earth                    
    As makes the nations groan.
                                  This active course
    He followed till provision for his wants
    Had been obtained the Wanderer then resolved
    To pass the remnant of his days, untasked
    With needless services, from hardship free.                  
    His calling laid aside, he lived at ease:
    But still he loved to pace the public roads
    And the wild paths; and, by the summer's warmth
    Invited, often would he leave his home
    And journey far, revisiting the scenes                      
    That to his memory were most endeared.
    Vigorous in health, of hopeful spirits, undamped
    By worldly-mindedness or anxious care;
    Observant, studious, thoughtful, and refreshed
    By knowledge gathered up from day to day;                    
    Thus had he lived a long and innocent life.

      The Scottish Church, both on himself and those
    With whom from childhood he grew up, had held
    The strong hand of her purity; and still
    Had watched him with an unrelenting eye.                     
    This he remembered in his riper age
    With gratitude, and reverential thoughts.
    But by the native vigour of his mind,
    By his habitual wanderings out of doors,
    By loneliness, and goodness, and kind works,                 
    Whateer, in docile childhood or in youth,
    He had imbibed of fear or darker thought
    Was melted all away; so true was this,
    That sometimes his religion seemed to me
    Self taught, as of a dreamer in the woods;                   
    Who to the model of his own pure heart
    Shaped his belief, as grace divine inspired,
    And human reason dictated with awe.
    And surely never did there live on earth
    A man of kindlier nature. The rough sports                   
    And teasing ways of children vexed not him;
    Indulgent listener was he to the tongue
    Of garrulous age; nor did the sick mans tale,
    To his fraternal sympathy addressed,
    Obtain reluctant hearing.
                                Plain his garb;                  
    Such as might suit a rustic Sire, prepared
    For sabbath duties; yet he was a man
    Whom no one could have passed without remark.
    Active and nervous was his gait; his limbs
    And his whole figure breathed intelligence.                  
    Time had compressed the freshness of his cheek
    Into a narrower circle of deep red,
    But had not tamed his eye; that, under brows
    Shaggy and grey, had meanings which it brought
    From years of youth; which, like a Being made            
    Of many Beings, he had wondrous skill
    To blend with knowledge of the years to come,
    Human, or such as lie beyond the grave.

      So was He framed; and such his course of life
    Who now, with no appendage but a staff,                      
    The prized memorial of relinquished toils,
    Upon that cottage-bench reposed his limbs,
    Screened from the sun. Supine the Wanderer lay,
    His eyes as if in drowsiness half shut,
    The shadows of the breezy elms above                         
    Dappling his face. He had not heard the sound
    Of my approaching steps, and in the shade
    Unnoticed did I stand some minutes space.
    At length I hailed him, seeing that his hat
    Was moist with water-drops, as if the brim                  
    Had newly scooped a running stream. He rose,
    And ere our lively greeting into peace
    Had settled, "Tis," said I, "a burning day:
    My lips are parched with thirst, but you, it seems,
    Have somewhere found relief." He, at the word,               
    Pointing towards a sweet briar, bade me climb
    The fence where that aspiring shrub looked out
    Upon the public way. It was a plot
    Of garden ground run wild, its matted weeds
    Marked with the steps of those, whom, as they passed,
    The gooseberry trees that shot in long lank slips,           
    Or currants, hanging from their leafless stems,
    In scanty strings, had tempted to oerleap
    The broken wall. I looked around, and there,
    Where two tall hedge rows of thick alder boughs              
    Joined in a cold damp nook, espied a well
    Shrouded with willow flowers and plumy fern.
    My thirst I slaked, and, from the cheerless spot
    Withdrawing, straightway to the shade returned
    Where sate the old Man on the cottage bench;                 
    And, while, beside him, with uncovered head,
    I yet was standing, freely to respire,
    And cool my temples in the fanning air,
    Thus did he speak. "I see around me here
    Things which you cannot see: we die, my Friend,              
    Nor we alone, but that which each man loved
    And prized in his peculiar nook of earth
    Dies with him, or is changed; and very soon
    Even of the good is no memorial left.
    The Poets, in their elegies and songs                      
    Lamenting the departed, call the groves,
    They call upon the hills and streams to mourn,
    And senseless rocks; nor idly; for they speak,
    In these their invocations, with a voice
    Obedient to the strong creative power                        
    Of human passion. Sympathies there are
    More tranquil, yet perhaps of kindred birth,
    That steal upon the meditative mind,
    And grow with thought. Beside yon spring I stood,
    And eyed its waters till we seemed to feel                   
    One sadness, they and I. For them a bond
    Of brotherhood is broken: time has been
    When, every day, the touch of human hand
    Dislodged the natural sleep that binds them up
    In mortal stillness; and they ministered                     
    To human comfort. Stooping down to drink,
    Upon the slimy foot-stone I espied
    The useless fragment of a wooden bowl,
    Green with the moss of years, and subject only
    To the soft handling of the elements:                        
    There let it lie how foolish are such thoughts!
    Forgive them never never did my steps
    Approach this door but she who dwelt within
    A daughter's welcome gave me, and I loved her
    As my own child. Oh, Sir! the good die first,
    And they whose hearts are dry as summer dust
    Burn to the socket. Many a passenger
    Hath blessed poor Margaret for her gentle looks,
    When she upheld the cool refreshment drawn
    From that forsaken spring; and no one came                   
    But he was welcome; no one went away
    But that it seemed she loved him. She is dead,
    The light extinguished of her lonely hut,
    The hut itself abandoned to decay,
    And she forgotten in the quiet grave.                        

      "I speak," continued he, "of One whose stock
    Of virtues bloomed beneath this lowly roof.
    She was a Woman of a steady mind,
    Tender and deep in her excess of love;
    Not speaking much, pleased rather with the joy               
    Of her own thoughts: by some especial care
    Her temper had been framed, as if to make
    A Being, who by adding love to peace
    Might live on earth a life of happiness.
    Her wedded Partner lacked not on his side                    
    The humble worth that satisfied her heart:
    Frugal, affectionate, sober, and withal
    Keenly industrious. She with pride would tell
    That he was often seated at his loom,
    In summer, ere the mower was abroad                          
    Among the dewy grass, in early spring,
    Ere the last star had vanished.They who passed
    At evening, from behind the garden fence
    Might hear his busy spade, which he would ply,
    After his daily work, until the light                        
    Had failed, and every leaf and flower were lost
    In the dark hedges. So their days were spent
    In peace and comfort; and a pretty boy
    Was their best hope, next to the God in heaven.

      "Not twenty years ago, but you I think                    
    Can scarcely bear it now in mind, there came
    Two blighting seasons, when the fields were left
    With half a harvest. It pleased Heaven to add
    A worse affliction in the plague of war:
    This happy Land was stricken to the heart!                   
    A Wanderer then among the cottages,
    I, with my freight of winter raiment, saw
    The hardships of that season: many rich
    Sank down, as in a dream, among the poor;
    And of the poor did many cease to be,                        
    And their place knew them not. Meanwhile, abridged
    Of daily comforts, gladly reconciled
    To numerous self-denials, Margaret
    Went struggling on through those calamitous years
    With cheerful hope, until the second autumn,                 
    When her lifes Helpmate on a sick-bed lay,
    Smitten with perilous fever. In disease
    He lingered long; and, when his strength returned,
    He found the little he had stored, to meet
    The hour of accident or crippling age,                       
    Was all consumed. A second infant now
    Was added to the troubles of a time
    Laden, for them and all of their degree,
    With care and sorrow: shoals of artisans
    From ill requited labour turned adrift                       
    Sought daily bread from public charity,
    They, and their wives and children happier far
    Could they have lived as do the little birds
    That peck along the hedgerows, or the kite
    That makes her dwelling on the mountain rocks!
      "A sad reverse it was for him who long
    Had filled with plenty, and possessed in peace,
    This lonely Cottage. At the door he stood,
    And whistled many a snatch of merry tunes
    That had no mirth in them; or with his knife             
    Carved uncouth figures on the heads of sticks
    Then, not less idly, sought, through every nook
    In house or garden, any casual work
    Of use or ornament; and with a strange,
    Amusing, yet uneasy, novelty,                                
    He mingled, where he might, the various tasks
    Of summer, autumn, winter, and of spring.
    But this endured not; his good humour soon
    Became a weight in which no pleasure was:
    And poverty brought on a petted mood                         
    And a sore temper: day by day he drooped,
    And he would leave his work and to the town
    Would turn without an errand his slack steps;
    Or wander here and there among the fields.
    One while he would speak lightly of his babes,               
    And with a cruel tongue; at other times
    He tossed them with a false unnatural joy:
    And 'twas a rueful thing to see the looks
    Of the poor innocent children. 'Every smile,'
    Said Margaret to me, here beneath these trees,               
    'Made my heart bleed.'"
                              At this the Wanderer paused;
    And, looking up to those enormous elms,
    He said, "Tis now the hour of deepest noon.
    At this still season of repose and peace,
    This hour when all things which are not at rest              
    Are cheerful; while this multitude of flies
    With tuneful hum is filling all the air;
    Why should a tear be on an old Man's cheek?
    Why should we thus, with an untoward mind,
    And in the weakness of humanity,                             
    From natural wisdom turn our hearts away;
    To natural comfort shut our eyes and ears;
    And, feeding on disquiet, thus disturb
    The calm of nature with our restless thoughts?"

    He spake with somewhat of a solemn tone:                     
    But, when he ended, there was in his face
    Such easy cheerfulness, a look so mild,
    That for a little time it stole away
    All recollection; and that simple tale
    Passed from my mind like a forgotten sound.                  
    A while on trivial things we held discourse,
    To me soon tasteless. In my own despite,
    I thought of that poor Woman as of one
    Whom I had known and loved. He had rehearsed
    Her homely tale with such familiar power,                    
    With such an active countenance, an eye
    So busy, that the things of which he spake
    Seemed present; and, attention now relaxed,
    A heartfelt chillness crept along my veins.
    I rose; and, having left the breezy shade,                   
    Stood drinking comfort from the warmer sun,
    That had not cheered me long ere, looking round
    Upon that tranquil Ruin, I returned,
    And begged of the old Man that, for my sake,
    He would resume his story.
                                He replied,                      
    "It were a wantonness, and would demand
    Severe reproof, if we were men whose hearts
    Could hold vain dalliance with the misery
    Even of the dead; contented thence to draw
    A momentary pleasure, never marked                           
    By reason, barren of all future good.
    But we have known that there is often found
    In mournful thoughts, and always might be found,
    A power to virtue friendly; wert not so,
    I am a dreamer among men, indeed                             
    An idle dreamer! Tis a common tale,
    An ordinary sorrow of man's life,
    A tale of silent suffering, hardly clothed
    In bodily form. But without further bidding
    I will proceed.
                    "While thus it fared with them,              
    To whom this cottage, till those hapless years,
    Had been a blessed home, it was my chance
    To travel in a country far remote;
    And when these lofty elms once more appeared
    What pleasant expectations lured me on                       
    O'er the flat Common! With quick step I reached
    The threshold, lifted with light hand the latch;
    But, when I entered, Margaret looked at me
    A little while; then turned her head away
    Speechless, and, sitting down upon a chair,                 
    Wept bitterly. I wist not what to do,
    Nor how to speak to her. Poor Wretch! at last
    She rose from off her seat, and then, O Sir!
    I cannot tell how she pronounced my name:
    With fervent love, and with a face of grief                  
    Unutterably helpless, and a look
    That seemed to cling upon me, she enquired
    If I had seen her husband. As she spake
    A strange surprise and fear came to my heart,
    Nor had I power to answer ere she told                       
    That he had disappeared not two months gone.
    He left his house: two wretched days had past,
    And on the third, as wistfully she raised
    Her head from off her pillow, to look forth,
    Like one in trouble, for returning light,                    
    Within her chamber casement she espied
    A folded paper, lying as if placed
    To meet her waking eyes. This tremblingly
    She opened found no writing, but beheld
    Pieces of money carefully enclosed,                          
    Silver and gold. I shuddered at the sight,
    Said Margaret, for I knew it was his hand
    That must have placed it there; and ere that day
    Was ended, that long anxious day, I learned,
    From one who by my husband had been sent                     
    With the sad news, that he had joined a troop
    Of soldiers, going to a distant land.
    He left me thus he could not gather heart
    To take a farewell of me; for he feared
    That I should follow with my babes, and sink                 
    Beneath the misery of that wandering life.

      "This tale did Margaret tell with many tears:
    And, when she ended, I had little power
    To give her comfort, and was glad to take                    
    Such words of hope from her own mouth as served
    To cheer us both. But long we had not talked
    Ere we built up a pile of better thoughts,
    And with a brighter eye she looked around
    As if she had been shedding tears of joy.
    We parted. Twas the time of early spring;                  
    I left her busy with her garden tools;
    And well remember, oer that fence she looked,
    And, while I paced along the foot-way path,
    Called out, and sent a blessing after me,
    With tender cheerfulness, and with a voice                   
    That seemed the very sound of happy thoughts.

      "I roved oer many a hill and many a dale,
    With my accustomed load; in heat and cold,
    Through many a wood and many an open ground,
    In sunshine and in shade, in wet and fair,                   
    Drooping or blithe of heart, as might befal;
    My best companions now the driving winds,
    And now the trotting brooks and whispering trees,
    And now the music of my own sad steps,
    With many a short lived thought that passed between,
    And disappeared.
                       "I journeyed back this way,               
    When, in the warmth of midsummer, the wheat
    Was yellow; and the soft and bladed grass,
    Springing afresh, had oer the hayfield spread
    Its tender verdure. At the door arrived,                     
    I found that she was absent. In the shade,
    Where now we sit, I waited her return.
    Her cottage, then a cheerful object, wore
    Its customary look, only, it seemed,
    The honeysuckle, crowding round the porch,                  
    Hung down in heavier tufts; and that bright weed,
    The yellow stone crop, suffered to take root
    Along the window's edge, profusely grew
    Blinding the lower panes. I turned aside,
    And strolled into her garden. It appeared                    
    To lag behind the season, and had lost
    Its pride of neatness. Daisy flowers and thrift
    Had broken their trim borderlines, and straggled
    Oer paths they used to deck carnations, once
    Prized for surpassing beauty, and no less                    
    For the peculiar pains they had required,
    Declined their languid heads, wanting support.
    The cumbrous bind-weed with its wreaths and bells,
    Had twined about her two small rows of peas,                 
    And dragged them to the earth.
                                   "Ere this an hour
    Was wasted. Back I turned my restless steps;
    A stranger passed; and, guessing whom I sought,
    He said that she was used to ramble far.
    The sun was sinking in the west; and now
    I sate with sad impatience. From within                      
    Her solitary infant cried aloud;
    Then, like a blast that dies away self stilled,
    The voice was silent. From the bench I rose;
    But neither could divert nor soothe my thoughts.
    The spot, though fair, was very desolate                
    The longer I remained, more desolate
    And, looking round me, now I first observed
    The corner stones, on either side the porch,
    With dull red stains discoloured, and stuck oer
    With tufts and hairs of wool, as if the sheep,               
    That fed upon the Common, thither came
    Familiarly, and found a couching place
    Even at her threshold. Deeper shadows fell
    From these tall elms; the cottageclock struck eight
    I turned, and saw her distant a few steps.                   
    Her face was pale and thin her figure, too,
    Was changed. As she unlocked the door, she said,
    It grieves me you have waited here so long,
    But, in good truth, Ive wandered much of late;
    And, sometimes to my shame I speak have need
    Of my best prayers to bring me back again.'                  
    While on the board she spread our evening meal,
    She told me interrupting not the work
    Which gave employment to her listless hands
    That she had parted with her elder child                  
    To a kind master on a distant farm
    Now happily apprenticed. I perceive
    You look at me, and you have cause; today
    I have been travelling far; and many days
    About the fields I wander, knowing this                      
    Only that what I seek I cannot find;
    And so I waste my time: for I am changed;
    And to myself, said she, have done much wrong
    And to this helpless infant. I have slept
    Weeping, and weeping have I waked my tears              
    Have flowed as if my body were not such
    As others are and I could never die.
    But I am now in mind and in my heart
    More easy; and I hope, said she, that God
    Will give me patience to endure the things                  
    Which I behold at home.
                            "It would have grieved
    Your very soul to see her. Sir, I feel
    The story linger in my heart; I fear
    Tis long and tedious; but my spirit clings
    To that poor Woman: so familiarly                           
    Do I perceive her manner, and her look,
    And presence; and so deeply do I feel
    Her goodness, that, not seldom, in my walks
    A momentary trance comes over me;
    And to myself I seem to muse on One                          
    By sorrow laid asleep; or borne away,
    A human being destined to awake
    To human life, or something very near
    To human life, when he shall come again
    For whom she suffered. Yes, it would have grieved            
    Your very soul to see her evermore
    Her eyelids drooped, her eyes downward were cast;
    And, when she at her table gave me food,
    She did not look at me. Her voice was low,
    Her body was subdued. In every act                           
    Pertaining to her house affairs, appeared
    The careless stillness of a thinking mind
    Self-occupied; to which all outward things
    Are like an idle matter. Still she sighed,
    But yet no motion of the breast was seen,                    
    No heaving of the heart. While by the fire
    We sate together, sighs came on my ear,
    I knew not how, and hardly whence they came.

      "Ere my departure, to her care I gave,
    For her sons use, some tokens of regard,                    
    Which with a look of welcome she received;
    And I exhorted her to place her trust
    In Gods good love, and seek his help by prayer.
    I took my staff, and, when I kissed her babe,
    The tears stood in her eyes. I left her then                 
    With the best hope and comfort I could give:
    She thanked me for my wish but for my hope
    It seemed she did not thank me.
                                       "I returned,
    And took my rounds along this road again
    When on its sunny bank the primrose flower               
    Peeped forth, to give an earnest of the Spring.
    I found her sad and drooping: she had learned
    No tidings of her husband; if he lived,
    She knew not that he lived; if he were dead,                 
    She knew not he was dead. She seemed the same
    In person and appearance; but her house
    Bespake a sleepy hand of negligence;
    The floor was neither dry nor neat, the hearth
    Was comfortless, and her small lot of books,
    Which, in the cottage-window, heretofore                     
    Had been piled up against the corner panes
    In seemly order, now, with straggling leaves
    Lay scattered here and there, open or shut,
    As they had chanced to fall. Her infant Babe
    Had from its Mother caught the trick of grief,               
    And sighed among its playthings. I withdrew,
    And once again entering the garden saw,
    More plainly still, that poverty and grief
    Were now come nearer to her: weeds defaced
    The hardened soil, and knots of withered grass:              
    No ridges there appeared of clear black mould,
    No winter greenness; of her herbs and flowers,
    It seemed the better part were gnawed away
    Or trampled into earth; a chain of straw,
    Which had been twined about the slender stem                 
    Of a young apple tree, lay at its root;
    The bark was nibbled round by truant sheep.
    Margaret stood near, her infant in her arms,
    And, noting that my eye was on the tree,
    She said, 'I fear it will be dead and gone                   
    Ere Robert come again.' When to the House
    We had returned together, she enquired
    If I had any hope but for her babe
    And for her little orphan boy, she said,
    She had no wish to live, that she must die                   
    Of sorrow. Yet I saw the idle loom
    Still in its place; his sunday garments hung
    Upon the self-same nail; his very staff
    Stood undisturbed behind the door.
                                       "And when,
    In bleak December, I retraced this way,                      
    She told me that her little babe was dead,
    And she was left alone. She now, released
    From her maternal cares, had taken up
    The employment common through these wilds, and gained,
    By spinning hemp, a pittance for herself;                    
    And for this end had hired a neighbours boy
    To give her needful help. That very time
    Most willingly she put her work aside,
    And walked with me along the miry road,
    Heedless how far; and, in such piteous sort                  
    That any heart had ached to hear her, begged
    That, wheresoeer I went, I still would ask
    For him whom she had lost. We parted then
    Our final parting; for from that time forth
    Did many seasons pass ere I returned                         
    Into this tract again.
                           "Nine tedious years;
    From their first separation, nine long years,
    She lingered in unquiet widowhood;
    A Wife and Widow. Needs must it have been
    A sore heart-wasting! I have heard, my Friend,               
    That in yon arbour oftentimes she sate
    Alone, through half the vacant sabbath day;
    And, if a dog passed by, she still would quit
    The shade, and look abroad. On this old bench
    For hours she sate; and evermore her eye                     
    Was busy in the distance, shaping things
    That made her heart beat quick. You see that path,
    Now faint, the grass has crept oer its grey line;
    There, to and fro, she paced through many a day
    Of the warm summer, from a belt of hemp                      
    That girt her waist, spinning the long-drawn thread
    With backward steps. Yet ever as there passed
    A man whose garments showed the soldiers red,
    Or crippled mendicant in sailors garb,
    The little child who sate to turn the wheel                  
    Ceased from his task; and she with faltering voice
    Made many a fond enquiry; and when they,
    Whose presence gave no comfort, were gone by,
    Her heart was still more sad. And by yon gate,
    That bars the travellers road, she often stood,             
    And when a stranger horseman came, the latch
    Would lift, and in his face look wistfully:
    Most happy, if, from aught discovered there
    Of tender feeling, she might dare repeat
    The same sad question. Meanwhile her poor Hut                
    Sank to decay; for he was gone, whose hand,
    At the first nipping of October frost,
    Closed up each chink, and with fresh bands of straw
    Chequered the green-grown thatch. And so she lived
    Through the long winter, reckless and alone;                 
    Until her house by frost, and thaw, and rain,
    Was sapped; and while she slept, the nightly damps
    Did chill her breast; and in the stormy day
    Her tattered clothes were ruffled by the wind,
    Even at the side of her own fire. Yet still                  
    She loved this wretched spot, nor would for worlds
    Have parted hence; and still that length of road,
    And this rude bench, one torturing hope endeared,
    Fast rooted at her heart: and here, my Friend,--
    In sickness she remained; and here she died;                 
    Last human tenant of these ruined walls!"

      The old Man ceased: he saw that I was moved;
    From that low bench, rising instinctively
    I turned aside in weakness, nor had power
    To thank him for the tale which he had told.                 
    I stood, and leaning oer the garden wall
    Reviewed that Woman's sufferings; and it seemed
    To comfort me while with a brothers love
    I blessed her in the impotence of grief.
    Then towards the cottage I returned; and traced             
    Fondly, though with an interest more mild,
    That secret spirit of humanity
    Which, mid the calm oblivious tendencies
    Of nature, mid her plants, and weeds, and flowers,
    And silent overgrowings, still survived.                     
    The old Man, noting this, resumed, and said,
    "My Friend! enough to sorrow you have given,
    The purposes of wisdom ask no more:
    Nor more would she have craved as due to One
    Who, in her worst distress, had oft times felt               
    The unbounded might of prayer; and learned, with soul
    Fixed on the Cross, that consolation springs,
    From sources deeper far than deepest pain,
    For the meek Sufferer. Why then should we read
    The forms of things with an unworthy eye?
    She sleeps in the calm earth, and peace is here.
    I well remember that those very plumes,
    Those weeds, and the high spear-grass on that wall,
    By mist and silent rain drops silvered oer,
    As once I passed, into my heart conveyed
    So still an image of tranquillity,
    So calm and still, and looked so beautiful
    Amid the uneasy thoughts which filled my mind,
    That what we feel of sorrow and despair
    From ruin and from change, and all the grief                 
    That passing shows of Being leave behind,
    Appeared an idle dream, that could maintain,
    Nowhere, dominion oer the enlightened spirit
    Whose meditative sympathies repose
    Upon the breast of Faith. I turned away,
    And walked along my road in happiness."

      He ceased. Ere long the sun declining shot
    A slant and mellow radiance, which began
    To fall upon us, while, beneath the trees,
    We sate on that low bench: and now we felt,                  
    Admonished thus, the sweet hour coming on.
    A linnet warbled from those lofty elms,
    A thrush sang loud, and other melodies,
    At distance heard, peopled the milder air.
    The old Man rose, and, with a sprightly mien                 
    Of hopeful preparation, grasped his staff
    Together casting then a farewell look
    Upon those silent walls, we left the shade;
    And, ere the stars were visible, had reached
    A village inn, our evening resting-place.
