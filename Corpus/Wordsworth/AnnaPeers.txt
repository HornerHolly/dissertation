  While Anna's peers and early playmates tread,
    In freedom, mountain-turf and river's marge;
    Or float with music in the festal barge;
    Rein the proud steed, or through the dance are led;
    Her doom it is to press a weary bed--                         
    Till oft her guardian Angel, to some charge
    More urgent called, will stretch his wings at large,
    And friends too rarely prop the languid head.
    Yet, helped by Genius untired comforter,
    The presence even of a stuffed Owl for her                        
    Can cheat the time; sending her fancy out
    To ivied castles and to moonlight skies,
    Though he can neither stir a plume, nor shout;
    Nor veil, with restless film, his staring eyes.
