  Brook! whose society the Poet seeks,
    Intent his wasted spirits to renew;
    And whom the curious Painter doth pursue
    Through rocky passes, among flowery creeks,
    And tracks thee dancing down thy water-breaks;               
    If wish were mine some type of thee to view,
    Thee, and not thee thyself, I would not do
    Like Grecian Artists, give thee human cheeks,
    Channels for tears; no Naiad should'st thou be,--
    Have neither limbs, feet, feathers, joints nor hairs:       
    It seems the Eternal Soul is clothed in thee
    With purer robes than those of flesh and blood,
    And hath bestowed on thee a safer good;
    Unwearied joy, and life without its cares.
