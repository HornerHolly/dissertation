Glory to God! and to the Power who came
    In filial duty, clothed with love divine,
    That made his human tabernacle shine
    Like Ocean burning with purpureal flame;
    Or like the Alpine Mount, that takes its name                      
    From roseate hues, far kenned at morn and even,
    In hours of peace, or when the storm is driven
    Along the nether region's rugged frame!
    Earth prompts--Heaven urges; let us seek the light,
    Studious of that pure intercourse begun                           
    When first our infant brows their lustre won;
    So, like the Mountain, may we grow more bright
    From unimpeded commerce with the Sun,
    At the approach of all-involving night.
