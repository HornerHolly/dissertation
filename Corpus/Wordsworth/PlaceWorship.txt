 As star that shines dependent upon star
    Is to the sky while we look up in love;
    As to the deep fair ships which though they move
    Seem fixed, to eyes that watch them from afar;
    As to the sandy desert fountains are,                              
    With palm-groves shaded at wide intervals,
    Whose fruit around the sun-burnt Native falls
    Of roving tired or desultory war--
    Such to this British Isle her christian Fanes,
    Each linked to each for kindred services;                         
    Her Spires, her Steeple-towers with glittering vanes
    Far-kenned, her Chapels lurking among trees,
    Where a few villagers on bended knees
    Find solace which a busy world disdains.
