From the fierce aspect of this River, throwing
    His giant body o'er the steep rock's brink,
    Back in astonishment and fear we shrink:
    But, gradually a calmer look bestowing,
    Flowers we espy beside the torrent growing;                    
    Flowers that peep forth from many a cleft and chink,
    And, from the whirlwind of his anger, drink
    Hues ever fresh, in rocky fortress blowing:
    They suck--from breath that, threatening to destroy,
    Is more benignant than the dewy eve--                         
    Beauty, and life, and motions as of joy:
    Nor doubt but HE to whom yon Pine-trees nod
    Their heads in sign of worship, Nature's God,
    These humbler adorations will receive.
