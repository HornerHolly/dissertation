 While the Poor gather round, till the end of time
    May this bright flower of Charity display
    Its bloom, unfolding at the appointed day;
    Flower than the loveliest of the vernal prime
    Lovelier--transplanted from heaven's purest clime!                 
    "Charity never faileth:" on that creed,
    More than on written testament or deed,
    The pious Lady built with hope sublime.
    Alms on this stone to be dealt out, _for ever_!
    "LAUS DEO." Many a Stranger passing by                            
    Has with that Parting mixed a filial sigh,
    Blest its humane Memorial's fond endeavour;
    And, fastening on those lines an eye tear-glazed,
    Has ended, though no Clerk, with "God be praised!"
