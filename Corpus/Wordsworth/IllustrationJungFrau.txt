The Virgin Mountain, wearing like a Queen
    A brilliant crown of everlasting snow,
    Sheds ruin from her sides; and men below
    Wonder that aught of aspect so serene
    Can link with desolation. Smooth and green,
    And seeming, at a little distance, slow,
    The waters of the Rhine; but on they go
    Fretting and whitening, keener and more keen;
    Till madness seizes on the whole wide Flood,
    Turned to a fearful Thing whose nostrils breathe                  
    Blasts of tempestuous smoke--wherewith he tries
    To hide himself, but only magnifies;
    And doth in more conspicuous torment writhe,
    Deafening the region in his ireful mood.
