 By a blest Husband guided, Mary came
    From nearest kindred, Vernon her new name;
    She came, though meek of soul, in seemly pride
    Of happiness and hope, a youthful Bride.
    O dread reverse! if aught be so, which proves                    
    That God will chasten whom he dearly loves.
    Faith bore her up through pains in mercy given,
    And troubles that were each a step to Heaven:
    Two Babes were laid in earth before she died;
    A third now slumbers at the Mother side;                        
    Its Sister twin survives, whose smiles afford
    A trembling solace to her widowed Lord.

      Reader! if to thy bosom cling the pain
    Of recent sorrow combated in vain;
    Or if thy cherished grief have failed to thwart                   
    Time still intent on his insidious part,
    Lulling the mourner best good thoughts asleep,
    Pilfering regrets we would, but cannot, keep;
    Bear with Him judge Him gently who makes known
    His bitter loss by this memorial Stone;                           
    And pray that in his faithful breast the grace
    Of resignation find a hallowed place.
