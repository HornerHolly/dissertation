  Ye Trees! whose slender roots entwine
      Altars that piety neglects;
    Whose infant arms enclasp the shrine
      Which no devotion now respects;
    If not a straggler from the herd                                   
    Here ruminate, nor shrouded bird,
    Chanting her low-voiced hymn, take pride
    In aught that ye would grace or hide--
    How sadly is your love misplaced,
    Fair Trees, your bounty run to waste!                             

    Ye, too, wild Flowers! that no one heeds,
    And ye--full often spurned as weeds--
    In beauty clothed, or breathing sweetness
    From fractured arch and mouldering wall--
    Do but more touchingly recal                                      
    Man’s headstrong violence and Time’s fleetness,
    Making the precincts ye adorn
    Appear to sight still more forlorn.
