 "Thou look'st upon me, and dost fondly think,
    Poet! that, stricken as both are by years,
    We, differing once so much, are now Compeers,
    Prepared, when each has stood his time, to sink
    Into the dust. Erewhile a sterner link                             
    United us; when thou, in boyish play,
    Entering my dungeon, didst become a prey
    To soul-appalling darkness. Not a blink
    Of light was there;--and thus did I, thy Tutor,
    Make thy young thoughts acquainted with the grave;
    While thou wert chasing the wing'd butterfly                      
    Through my green courts; or climbing, a bold suitor
    Up to the flowers whose golden progeny
    Still round my shattered brow in beauty wave."
