Dear  be the Church, that, watching o'er the needs
    Of Infancy, provides a timely shower
    Whose virtue changes to a Christian Flower
    A Growth from sinful Nature's bed of weeds!
    Fitliest beneath the sacred roof proceeds                          
    The ministration; while parental Love
    Looks on, and Grace descendeth from above
    As the high service pledges now, now pleads.
    There, should vain thoughts outspread their wings and fly
    To meet the coming hours of festal mirth,                         
    The tombs which hear and answer that brief cry,
    The Infant's notice of his second birth--
    Recal the wandering Soul to sympathy
    With what man hopes from Heaven, yet fears from Earth.
