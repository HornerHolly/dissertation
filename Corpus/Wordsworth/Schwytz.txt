By antique Fancy trimmed--though lowly, bred
    To dignity--in thee, O SCHWYTZ! are seen
    The genuine features of the golden mean;
    Equality by Prudence govern√®d,
    Or jealous Nature ruling in her stead;                         
    And, therefore, art thou blest with peace, serene
    As that of the sweet fields and meadows green
    In unambitious compass round thee spread.
    Majestic BERNE, high on her guardian steep,
    Holding a central station of command,                         
    Might well be styled this noble body's HEAD,
    Thou, lodged 'mid mountainous entrenchments deep,
    Its HEART; and ever may the heroic Land,
    Thy name, O SCHWYTZ, in happy freedom keep!
