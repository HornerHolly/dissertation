 Thanks for the lessons of this Spot--fit school
    For the presumptuous thoughts that would assign
    Mechanic laws to agency divine;
    And, measuring heaven by earth, would overrule
    Infinite Power. The pillared vestibule,                           
    Expanding yet precise, the roof embowed,
    Might seem designed to humble man, when proud
    Of his best workmanship by plan and tool.
    Down-bearing with his whole Atlantic weight
    Of tide and tempest on the Structure's base,                      
    And flashing to that Structure's topmost height,
    Ocean has proved its strength, and of its grace
    In calms is conscious, finding for his freight
    Of softest music some responsive place.
