  The Scottish Broom on Bird-nest brae
    Twelve tedious years ago,
    When many plants strange blossoms bore
    That puzzled high and low,
    A not unnatural longing felt,                                      
    What longing would ye know?
    Why, friend, to deck her supple twigs
    With _yellow_ in full blow.

    To Lowther Castle she addressed
    A prayer both bold and sly,                                       
    (For all the Brooms on Bird-nest brae
    Can talk and speechify)
    That flattering breezes blowing thence
    Their succour would supply,
    Then she would instantly put forth                                
    A flag of _yellow_ dye.

    But from the Castle turret blew
    A chill forbidding blast,
    Which the poor Broom no sooner felt
    Than she shrank up so fast;                                       
    Her _wished-for_ yellow she forswore,
    And since that time has cast
    Fond looks on colours three or four
    And put forth _Blue_ at last.
    And now, my lads, the Election comes                              
    In June’s sunshining hours,
    When every field and bank and brae
    Is clad with yellow flowers.
    While faction Blue from shops and booths
    Tricks out her blustering powers,                                 
    Lo! smiling Nature’s lavish hand
    Has furnished wreaths for ours.
