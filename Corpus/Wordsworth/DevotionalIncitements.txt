 Where will they stop, those breathing Powers,
    The Spirits of the new-born flowers?
    They wander with the breeze, they wind
    Where'er the streams a passage find;
    Up from their native ground they rise                              
    In mute aÃ«rial harmonies;
    From humble violet--modest thyme--
    Exhaled, the essential odours climb,
    As if no space below the sky
    Their subtle flight could satisfy:                                
    Heaven will not tax our thoughts with pride
    If like ambition be _their_ guide.

      Roused by this kindliest of May-showers,
    The spirit-quickener of the flowers,
    That with moist virtue softly cleaves                             
    The buds, and freshens the young leaves,
    The birds pour forth their souls in notes
    Of rapture from a thousand throats--
    Here checked by too impetuous haste,
    While there the music runs to waste,                              
    With bounty more and more enlarged,
    Till the whole air is overcharged;
    Give ear, O Man! to their appeal
    And thirst for no inferior zeal,
    Thou, who canst _think_, as well as feel.                        

      Mount from the earth; aspire! aspire!
    So pleads the town's cathedral quire,
    In strains that from their solemn height
    Sink, to attain a loftier flight;
    While incense from the altar breathes                            
    Rich fragrance in embodied wreaths;
    Or, flung from swinging censer, shrouds
    The taper-lights, and curls in clouds
    Around angelic Forms, the still
    Creation of the painter's skill,                                  
    That on the service wait concealed
    One moment, and the next revealed.
    --Cast off your bonds, awake, arise,
    And for no transient ecstasies!
    What else can mean the visual plea                                
    Of still or moving imagery--
    The iterated summons loud,
    Not wasted on the attendant crowd,
    Nor wholly lost upon the throng
    Hurrying the busy streets along?                                  
      Alas! the sanctities combined
    By art to unsensualise the mind,
    Decay and languish; or, as creeds
    And humours change, are spurned like weeds:
    The priests are from their altars thrust;                         
    Temples are levelled with the dust;
    And solemn rites and awful forms
    Founder amid fanatic storms.
    Yet evermore, through years renewed
    In undisturbed vicissitude                                        
    Of seasons balancing their flight
    On the swift wings of day and night,
    Kind Nature keeps a heavenly door
    Wide open for the scattered Poor.
    Where flower-breathed incense to the skies                       
    Is wafted in mute harmonies;
    And ground fresh-cloven by the plough
    Is fragrant with a humbler vow;
    Where birds and brooks from leafy dells
    Chime forth unwearied canticles,                                  
    And vapours magnify and spread
    The glory of the sun's bright head--
    Still constant in her worship, still
    Conforming to the eternal Will,
    Whether men sow or reap the fields,                               
    Divine monition Nature yields,
    That not by bread alone we live,
    Or what a hand of flesh can give;
    That every day should leave some part
    Free for a sabbath of the heart:                                  
    So shall the seventh be truly blest,
    From morn to eve, with hallowed rest.
