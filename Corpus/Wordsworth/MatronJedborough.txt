 Age! twine thy brows with fresh spring flowers,
  And call a train of laughing Hours;
  And bid them dance, and bid them sing;
  And thou, too, mingle in the ring!
  Take to thy heart a new delight;                              
  If not, make merry in despite
  That there is One who scorns thy power:--
  But dance! for under Jedborough Tower,
  A Matron dwells who, though she bears
  The weight of more than seventy years,                       
  Lives in the light of youthful glee, 
  And she will dance and sing with thee.

    Nay! start not at that Figure--there!
  Him who is rooted to his chair!
  Look at him--look again! for he                              
  Hath long been of thy family.
  With legs that move not, if they can,
  And useless arms, a trunk of man,
  He sits, and with a vacant eye;
  A sight to make a stranger sigh!                             
  Deaf, drooping, that is now his doom:
  His world is in this single room:
  Is this a place for mirthful cheer? 
  Can merry-making enter here? 

    The joyous Woman is the Mate                               
  Of him in that forlorn estate!
  He breathes a subterraneous damp;
  But bright as Vesper shines her lamp:
  He is as mute as Jedborough Tower:
  She jocund as it was of yore,                               
  With all its bravery on; in times
  When all alive with merry chimes,
  Upon a sun-bright morn of May,
  It roused the Vale to holiday.

    I praise thee, Matron! and thy due                         
  Is praise, heroic praise, and true!
  With admiration I behold
  Thy gladness unsubdued and bold:
  Thy looks, thy gestures, all present
  The picture of a life well spent:                            
  This do I see; and something more;
  A strength unthought of heretofore!
  Delighted am I for thy sake;
  And yet a higher joy partake:
  Our Human-nature throws away                                 
  Its second twilight, and looks gay;
  A land of promise and of pride
  Unfolding, wide as life is wide.

    Ah! see her helpless Charge! enclosed
  Within himself as seems, composed;                           
  To fear of loss, and hope of gain,
  The strife of happiness and pain,
  Utterly dead! yet in the guise
  Of little infants, when their eyes
  Begin to follow to and fro                                   
  The persons that before them go,
  He tracks her motions, quick or slow.
  Her buoyant spirit can prevail
  Where common cheerfulness would fail;
  She strikes upon him with the heat                           
  Of July suns; he feels it sweet;
  An animal delight though dim!
  'Tis all that now remains for him!

    The more I looked, I wondered more--
  And, while I scanned them o'er and o'er,     
  Some inward trouble suddenly
  Broke from the Matron's strong black eye--
  A remnant of uneasy light,
  A flash of something over-bright!
  Nor long this mystery did detain                             
  My thoughts;--she told in pensive strain 
  That she had borne a heavy yoke,
  Been stricken by a twofold stroke;
  Ill health of body; and had pined
  Beneath worse ailments of the mind.                          

    So be it!--but let praise ascend
  To Him who is our lord and friend!
  Who from disease and suffering
  Hath called for thee a second spring;
  Repaid thee for that sore distress                           
  By no untimely joyousness;
  Which makes of thine a blissful state;
  And cheers thy melancholy Mate!
