 Lance, shield, and sword relinquished--at his side
    A bead-roll, in his hand a clasp√®d book,
    Or staff more harmless than a shepherd's crook,
    The war-worn Chieftain quits the world--to hide
    His thin autumnal locks where Monks abide                         
    In cloistered privacy. But not to dwell
    In soft repose he comes. Within his cell,
    Round the decaying trunk of human pride,
    At morn, and eve, and midnight's silent hour,
    Do penitential cogitations cling;                                 
    Like ivy, round some ancient elm, they twine
    In grisly folds and strictures serpentine;
    Yet, while they strangle, a fair growth they bring,
    For recompense--their own perennial bower.
