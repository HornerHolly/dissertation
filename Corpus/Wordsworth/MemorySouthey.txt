    Ye Vales and Hills, whose beauty hither drew
    The Poet’s steps, and fixed him here, on you
    His eyes have closed; and ye, loved Books, no more
    Shall Southey feed upon your precious lore,
    To Works that ne’er shall forfeit their renown
    Adding immortal labours of his own,
    As Fancy, disciplined by studious Art
    Informed his pen, or Wisdom of the heart,
    Or judgments rooted in a Patriot’s mind
    Taught to revere the rights of all mankind.
    Friends, Family--ah wherefore touch that string,
    To them _so_ fondly did the good man cling!
    His joys, his griefs, have vanished like a cloud
    From Skiddaw’s top; but He to Heaven was vowed
    Through a long life; and calmed by Christian faith,
    In his pure soul, the fear of change and death.
