By vain affections unenthralled,
    Though resolute when duty called
    To meet the world's broad eye,
    Pure as the holiest cloistered nun
    That ever feared the tempting sun,                                 
    Did Fermor live and die.

    This Tablet, hallowed by her name,
    One heart-relieving tear may claim;
    But if the pensive gloom
    Of fond regret be still thy choice,                               
    Exalt thy spirit, hear the voice
    Of Jesus from her tomb!
