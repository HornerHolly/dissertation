To a good Man of most dear memory
    This Stone is sacred. Here he lies apart
    From the great city where he first drew breath,
    Was reared and taught; and humbly earned his bread,
    To the strict labours of the merchant desk                       
    By duty chained. Not seldom did those tasks
    Tease, and the thought of time so spent depress,
    His spirit, but the recompense was high;
    Firm Independence, Bounty rightful sire;
    Affections, warm as sunshine, free as air;                        
    And when the precious hours of leisure came,
    Knowledge and wisdom, gained from converse sweet
    With books, or while he ranged the crowded streets
    With a keen eye, and overflowing heart
    So genius triumphed over seeming wrong,                           
    And poured out truth in works by thoughtful love
    Inspired works potent over smiles and tears.
    And as round mountaintops the lightning plays,
    Thus innocently sported, breaking forth
    As from a cloud of some grave sympathy,                           
    Humour and wild instinctive wit, and all
    The vivid flashes of his spoken words.
    From the most gentle creature nursed in fields
    Had been derived the name he bore a name,
    Wherever christian altars have been raised,                      
    Hallowed to meekness and to innocence;
    And if in him meekness at times gave way,
    Provoked out of herself by troubles strange,
    Many and strange, that hung about his life
    Still, at the centre of his being, lodged                         
    A soul by resignation sanctified
    And if too often, selfreproached, he felt
    That innocence belongs not to our kind,
    A power that never ceased to abide in him,
    Charity, mid the multitude of sins
    That she can cover, left not his exposed
    To an unforgiving judgment from just Heaven.
    O, he was good, if eer a good Man lived!

    From a reflecting mind and sorrowing heart
    Those simple lines flowed with an earnest wish,                   
    Though but a doubting hope, that they might serve
    Fitly to guard the precious dust of him
    Whose virtues called them forth. That aim is missed;
    For much that truth most urgently required
    Had from a faltering pen been asked in vain:                      
    Yet, haply, on the printed page received,
    The imperfect record, there, may stand unblamed
    As long as verse of mine shall breathe the air
    Of memory, or see the light of love.

      Thou wert a scorner of the fields, my Friend,                   
    But more in show than truth and from the fields,
    And from the mountains, to thy rural grave
    Transported, my soothed spirit hovers oer
    Its green untrodden turf, and blowing flowers;
    And taking up a voice shall speak tho still                     
    Awed by the theme peculiar sanctity
    Which words less free presumed not even to touch
    Of that fraternal love, whose heaven-lit lamp
    From infancy, through manhood, to the last
    Of threescore years, and to thy latest hour,                      
    Burnt on with everstrengthening light, enshrined
    Within thy bosom.
                              Wonderful hath been
    The love established between man and man,
    Passing the love of women and between
    Man and his helpmate in fast wedlock joined                      
    Through God, is raised a spirit and soul of love
    Without whose blissful influence Paradise
    Had been no Paradise; and earth were now
    A waste where creatures bearing human form,
    Direst of savage beasts, would roam in fear,                      
    Joyless and comfortless. Our days glide on;
    And let him grieve who cannot choose but grieve
    That he hath been an Elm without his Vine,
    And her bright dower of clustering charities,
    That, round his trunk and branches, might have clung              
    Enriching and adorning. Unto thee,
    Not so enriched, not so adorned, to thee
    Was given say rather thou of later birth
    Wert given to her a Sister tis a word
    Timidly uttered, for she lives, the meek,                       
    The self-restraining, and the ever-kind;
    In whom thy reason and intelligent heart
    Found for all interests hopes and tender cares,
    All softening, humanising, hallowing powers,
    Whether withheld, or for her sake unsought                      
    More than sufficient recompense!
                                      Her love
    What weakness prompts the voice to tell it here?
    Was as the love of mothers; and when years,
    Lifting the boy to man estate, had called
    The long protected to assume the part                             
    Of a protector, the first filial tie
    Was undissolved; and, in or out of sight,
    Remained imperishably interwoven
    With life itself. Thus, mid a shifting world,
    Did they together testify of time
    And seasons difference a double tree
    With two collateral stems sprung from one root;
    Such were they such thro life they might have been
    In union, in partition only such;
    Otherwise wrought the will of the Most High;                     
    Yet, thro all visitations and all trials,
    Still they were faithful; like two vessels launched
    From the same beach one ocean to explore
    With mutual help, and sailing to their league
    True, as inexorable winds, or bars                               
    Floating or fixed of polar ice, allow.

      But turn we rather, let my spirit turn
    With thine, O silent and invisible Friend!
    To those dear intervals, nor rare nor brief,
    When reunited, and by choice withdrawn                           
    From miscellaneous converse, ye were taught
    That the remembrance of foregone distress,
    And the worse fear of future ill which oft
    Doth hang around it, as a sickly child
    Upon its mother may be both alike                               
    Disarmed of power to unsettle present good
    So prized, and things inward and outward held
    In such an even balance, that the heart
    Acknowledges Godâ€™s grace, his mercy feels,
    And in its depth of gratitude is still.                          

      O gift divine of quiet sequestration!
    The hermit, exercised in prayer and praise,
    And feeding daily on the hope of heaven,
    Is happy in his vow, and fondly cleaves
    To life long singleness; but happier far                        
    Was to your souls, and, to the thoughts of others,
    A thousand times more beautiful appeared,
    Your dual loneliness. The sacred tie
    Is broken; yet why grieve? for Time but holds
    His moiety in trust, till Joy shall lead                         
    To the blest world where parting is unknown.
