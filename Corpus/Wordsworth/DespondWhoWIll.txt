 Despond who will--_I_ heard a voice exclaim,
    "Though fierce the assault, and shatter'd the defence,
    It cannot be that Britain's social frame,
    The glorious work of time and providence,
    Before a flying season's rash pretence,               
    Should fall; that She, whose virtue put to shame,
    When Europe prostrate lay, the Conqueror's aim,
    Should perish, self-subverted. Black and dense
    The cloud is; but brings _that_ a day of doom
    To Liberty? Her sun is up the while,
    That orb whose beams round Saxon Alfred shone:
    Then laugh, ye innocent Vales! ye Streams, sweep on,
    Nor let one billow of our heaven-blest Isle
    Toss in the fanning wind a humbler plume."
