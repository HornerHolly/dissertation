Though joy attend Thee orient at the birth
    Of dawn, it cheers the lofty spirit most
    To watch thy course when Day-light, fled from earth,
    In the grey sky hath left his lingering Ghost,
    Perplexed as if between a splendour lost                           
    And splendour slowly mustering. Since the Sun,
    The absolute, the world-absorbing One,
    Relinquished half his empire to the host
    Emboldened by thy guidance, holy Star,
    Holy as princely, who that looks on thee                          
    Touching, as now, in thy humility
    The mountain borders of this seat of care,
    Can question that thy countenance is bright,
    Celestial Power, as much with love as light?
