 No more: the end is sudden and abrupt,
    Abrupt as without preconceived design
    Was the beginning; yet the several Lays
    Have moved in order, to each other bound
    By a continuous and acknowledged tie                               
    Though unapparent like those Shapes distinct
    That yet survive ensculptured on the walls
    Of palaces, or temples, mid the wreck
    Of famed Persepolis; each following each,
    As might beseem a stately embassy,
    In set array; these bearing in their hands
    Ensign of civil power, weapon of war,
    Or gift to be presented at the throne
    Of the Great King; and others, as they go
    In priestly vest, with holy offerings charged,                    
    Or leading victims drest for sacrifice.
    Nor will the Power we serve, that sacred Power,
    The Spirit of humanity, disdain
    A ministration humble but sincere,
    That from a threshold loved by every Muse                         
    Its impulse took--that sorrow-stricken door,
    Whence, as a current from its fountain-head,
    Our thoughts have issued, and our feelings flowed,
    Receiving, willingly or not, fresh strength
    From kindred sources; while around us sighed                      
    (Life's three first seasons having passed away)
    Leaf-scattering winds; and hoar-frost sprinklings fell
    (Foretaste of winter) on the moorland heights;
    And every day brought with it tidings new
    Of rash change, ominous for the public weal.                      
    Hence, if dejection has too oft encroached
    Upon that sweet and tender melancholy
    Which may itself be cherished and caressed
    More than enough; a fault so natural
    (Even with the young, the hopeful, or the gay)                    
    For prompt forgiveness will not sue in vain.
