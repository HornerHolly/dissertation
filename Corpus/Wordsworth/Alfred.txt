Behold a pupil of the monkish gown,
    The pious ALFRED, King to Justice dear!
    Lord of the harp and liberating spear;
    Mirror of Princes! Indigent Renown
    Might range the starry ether for a crown                           
    Equal to _his_ deserts, who, like the year,
    Pours forth his bounty, like the day doth cheer,
    And awes like night with mercy tempered frown.
    Ease from this noble miser of his time
    No moment steals; pain narrows not his cares.
    Though small his kingdom as a spark or gem,
    Of Alfred boasts remote Jerusalem,
    And Christian India, through her wide-spread clime,
    In sacred converse gifts with Alfred shares.
