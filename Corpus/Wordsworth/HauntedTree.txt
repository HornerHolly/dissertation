  Those silver clouds collected round the sun
    His mid-day warmth abate not, seeming less
    To overshade than multiply his beams
    By soft reflection--grateful to the sky,                       
    To rocks, fields, woods. Nor doth our human sense
    Ask, for its pleasure, screen or canopy
    More ample than the time-dismantled Oak
    Spreads o'er this tuft of heath, which now, attired
    In the whole fulness of its bloom, affords
    Couch beautiful as e'er for earthly use
    Was fashioned; whether by the hand of Art,
    That eastern Sultan, amid flowers enwrought
    On silken tissue, might diffuse his limbs
    In languor; or, by Nature, for repose
    Of panting Wood-nymph, wearied with the chase.
    O Lady! fairer in thy Poet's sight
    Than fairest spiritual creature of the groves,
    Approach;--and, thus invited, crown with rest
    The noontide hour: though truly some there are
    Whose footsteps superstitiously avoid                         
    This venerable Tree; for, when the wind
    Blows keenly, it sends forth a creaking sound
    (Above the general roar of woods and crags)
    Distinctly heard from far--a doleful note!
    As if (so Grecian shepherds would have deemed)                
    The Hamadryad, pent within, bewailed
    Some bitter wrong. Nor is it unbelieved,
    By ruder fancy, that a troubled ghost
    Haunts the old trunk; lamenting deeds of which
    The flowery ground is conscious. But no wind                  
    Sweeps now along this elevated ridge;
    Not even a zephyr stirs;--the obnoxious Tree
    Is mute: and, in his silence, would look down,
    O lovely Wanderer of the trackless hills,
    On thy reclining form with more delight                  
    Than his coevals in the sheltered vale
    Seem to participate, the while they view
    Their own far-stretching arms and leafy heads
    Vividly pictured in some glassy pool,
    That, for a brief space, checks the hurrying stream!
