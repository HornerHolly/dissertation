 Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray:
  And, when I crossed the wild,
  I chanced to see at break of day
  The solitary child.

  No mate, no comrade Lucy knew;                       
  She dwelt on a wide moor, 
--The sweetest thing that ever grew
  Beside a human door!

  You yet may spy the fawn at play,
  The hare upon the green;                            
  But the sweet face of Lucy Gray
  Will never more be seen.

  "To-night will be a stormy night--
  You to the town must go;
  And take a lantern, Child, to light                 
  Your mother through the snow."

  "That, Father! will I gladly do:
  'Tis scarcely afternoon--
  The minster-clock has just struck two,
  And yonder is the moon!"                            

  At this the Father raised his hook,
  And snapped  a faggot-band;
  He plied his work;--and Lucy took
  The lantern in her hand.

  Not blither is the mountain roe:                    
  With many a wanton stroke
  Her feet disperse the powdery snow,
  That rises up like smoke.

  The storm came on before its time:
  She wandered up and down;                           
  And many a hill did Lucy climb
  But never reached the town.

  The wretched parents all that night
  Went shouting far and wide;
  But there was neither sound nor sight               
  To serve them for a guide.

  At day-break on a hill they stood
  That overlooked the moor;
  And thence they saw the bridge of wood,
  A furlong from their door.                          

  They wept--and, turning homeward, cried, 
  "In heaven we all shall meet;"
--When in the snow the mother spied 
  The print of Lucy's feet.

  Then downwards  from the steep hill's edge       
  They tracked the footmarks small;
  And through the broken hawthorn hedge,
  And by the long stone-wall;

  And then an open field they crossed:
  The marks were still the same;                      
  They tracked them on, nor ever lost;
  And to the bridge they came.

  They followed from the snowy bank
  Those footmarks, one by one,
  Into the middle of the plank;                       
  And further there were none!

--Yet some maintain that to this day
  She is a living child;
  That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
  Upon the lonesome wild.                             

  O'er rough and smooth she trips along,
  And never looks behind;
  And sings a solitary song
  That whistles in the wind.
