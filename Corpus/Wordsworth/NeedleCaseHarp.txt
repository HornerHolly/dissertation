Frowns are on every Muse's face,
      Reproaches from their lips are sent,
    That mimicry should thus disgrace
      The noble Instrument.

    A very Harp in all but size!                                       
      Needles for strings in apt gradation!
    Minerva's self would stigmatize
      The unclassic profanation.

    Even her _own_ needle that subdued
      Arachne's rival spirit,
    Though wrought in Vulcan's happiest mood,
      Such honour could not merit.

    And this, too, from the Laureate's Child,
      A living lord of melody!
    How will her Sire be reconciled                                   
      To the refined indignity?

    I spake, when whispered a low voice,
      "Bard! moderate your ire;
    Spirits of all degrees rejoice
      In presence of the lyre.                                        

    The Minstrels of Pygmean bands,
      Dwarf Genii, moonlight-loving Fays,
    Have shells to fit their tiny hands
      And suit their slender lays.

    Some, still more delicate of ear,                                 
      Have lutes (believe my words)
    Whose framework is of gossamer,
      While sunbeams are the chords.

    Gay Sylphs this miniature will court,
      Made vocal by their brushing wings,                             
    And sullen Gnomes will learn to sport
      Around its polished strings;

    Whence strains to love-sick maiden dear,
      While in her lonely bower she tries
    To cheat the thought she cannot cheer,                            
      By fanciful embroideries.

    Trust, angry Bard! a knowing Sprite,
      Nor think the Harp her lot deplores;
    Though 'mid the stars the Lyre shine bright,
      Love _stoops_ as fondly as he soars."
