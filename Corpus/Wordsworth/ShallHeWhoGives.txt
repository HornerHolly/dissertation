    Shall he who gives his days to low pursuits
    Amid the undistinguishable crowd
    Of cities, mid the same eternal flow
    Of the same objects, melted and reduced
    To one identity, by differences                                    
    That have no law, no meaning, and no end,
    Shall he feel yearning to those lifeless forms,
    And shall we think that Nature is less kind
    To those, who all day long, through a busy life,
    Have walked within her sight? It cannot be.
