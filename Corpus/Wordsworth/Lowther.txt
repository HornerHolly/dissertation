Lowther! in thy majestic Pile are seen
    Cathedral pomp and grace, in apt accord
    With the baronial castle's sterner mien;
    Union significant of God adored,
    And charters won and guarded by the sword                         
    Of ancient honour; whence that goodly state
    Of polity which wise men venerate,
    And will maintain, if God his help afford.
    Hourly the democratic torrent swells;
    For airy promises and hopes suborned                              
    The strength of backward-looking thoughts is scorned.
    Fall if ye must, ye Towers and Pinnacles,
    With what ye symbolise; authentic Story
    Will say, Ye disappeared with England's Glory!
