  Thus they, with freaks of proud delight,
  Beguile the remnant of the night;
  And many a snatch of jovial song
  Regales them as they wind along;                                 
  While to the music, from on high,
  The echoes make a glad reply.
  But the sage Muse the revel heeds
  No farther than her story needs;
  Nor will she servilely attend                                    
  The loitering journey to its end.
Blithe spirits of her own impel
  The Muse, who scents the morning air,
  To take of this transported pair
  A brief and unreproved farewell;                                 
  To quit the slow paced waggons side,
  And wander down yon hawthorn dell,
  With murmuring Greta for her guide.
There doth she ken the awful form
  Of Raven crag black as a storm
  Glimmering through the twilight pale;
  And Ghimmer crag, his tall twin brother,
  Each peering forth to meet the other:
  And, while she roves through St. Johns Vale,
  Along the smooth unpathwayed plain,                              
  By sheeptrack or through cottage lane,
  Where no disturbance comes to intrude
  Upon the pensive solitude,
  Her unsuspecting eye, perchance,
  With the rude shepherds favoured glance,                        
  Beholds the faeries in array,
  Whose party coloured garments gay
  The silent company betray:
  Red, green, and blue; a moment's sight!
  For Skiddaw-top with rosy light                                  
  Is touched and all the band take flight.
Fly also, Muse! and from the dell
  Mount to the ridge of Nathdale Fell;
  Thence, look thou forth oer wood and lawn
  Hoar with the frostlike dews of dawn;                           
  Across yon meadowy bottom look,
  Where close fogs hide their parent brook;
  And see, beyond that hamlet small,
  The ruined towers of Threlkeld hall,
  Lurking in a double shade,                                       
  By trees and lingering twilight made!
  There, at Blencatharas rugged feet,
  Sir Lancelot gave a safe retreat
  To noble Clifford; from annoy
  Concealed the persecuted boy,                                    
  Well pleased in rustic garb to feed
  His flock, and pipe on shepherds reed
  Among this multitude of hills,
  Crags, woodlands, waterfalls, and rills;
  Which soon the morning shall enfold,                             
  From east to west, in ample vest
  Of massy gloom and radiance bold.

    The mists, that oer the streamlets bed
  Hung low, begin to rise and spread;
  Even while I speak, their skirts of grey                         
  Are smitten by a silver ray;
  And lo! up Castriggs naked steep
  Where, smoothly urged, the vapours sweep
  Along and scatter and divide,
  Like fleecy clouds self multiplied                           
  The stately waggon is ascending,
  With faithful Benjamin attending,
  Apparent now beside his team
  Now lost amid a glittering steam: 
  And with him goes his Sailor friend,                             
  By this time near their journey's end;
  And, after their high minded riot,
  Sickening into thoughtful quiet;
  As if the mornings pleasant hour,
  Had for their joys a killing power.                              
  And, sooth, for Benjamin a vein
  Is opened of still deeper pain,
  As if his heart by notes were stung
  From out the lowly hedge-rows flung;
  As if the warbler lost in light 
  Reproved his soarings of the night,
  In strains of rapture pure and holy
  Upbraided his distempered folly. 

    Drooping is he, his step is dull; 
  But the horses stretch and pull;                                
  With increasing vigour climb,
  Eager to repair lost time;
  Whether, by their own desert,
  Knowing what cause there is for shame,
  They are labouring to avert                                     
  As much as may be of the blame, 
  Which, they foresee, must soon alight
  Upon his head, whom, in despite
  Of all his failings, they love best; 
  Whether for him they are distrest,                               
  Or, by length of fasting roused,
  Are impatient to be housed:
  Up against the hill they strain
  Tugging at the iron chain,
  Tugging all with might and main,                                 
  Last and foremost, every horse
  To the utmost of his force!
  And the smoke and respiration,
  Rising like an exhalation,
  Blend with the mist a moving shroud                        
  To form, an undissolving cloud;
  Which, with slant ray, the merry sun
  Takes delight to play upon.
  Never golden haired Apollo,
  Pleased some favourite chief to follow                           
  Through accidents of peace or war,
  In a perilous moment threw
  Around the object of his care
  Veil of such celestial hue; 
  Interposed so bright a screen
  Him and his enemies between!

    Alas! what boots it? who can hide,
  When the malicious Fates are bent
  On working out an ill intent?
  Can destiny be turned aside?                                     
  No sad progress of my story!
  Benjamin, this outward glory
  Cannot shield thee from thy Master,
  Who from Keswick has pricked forth,
  Sour and surly as the north;                                     
  And, in fear of some disaster,
  Comes to give what help he may,
  And to hear what thou canst say;
  If, as needs he must forebode, 
  Thou hast been loitering on the road!                 
  His fears, his doubts, may now take flight
  The wished for object is in sight;
  Yet, trust the Muse, it rather hath
  Stirred him up to livelier wrath;
  Which he stifles, moody man!                                     
  With all the patience that he can;
  To the end that, at your meeting,
  He may give thee decent greeting.

    There he is resolved to stop,
  Till the waggon gains the top;                                   
  But stop he cannot must advance:
  Him Benjamin, with lucky glance,
  Espies and instantly is ready,
  Self collected, poised, and steady:
  And, to be the better seen,                                      
  Issues from his radiant shroud,
  From his close attending cloud,
  With careless air and open mien.
  Erect his port, and firm his going;
  So struts yon cock that now is crowing;                          
  And the morning light in grace
  Strikes upon his lifted face,
  Hurrying the pallid hue away
  That might his trespasses betray.
  But what can all avail to clear him,                             
  Or what need of explanation,
  Parley or interrogation?
  For the Master sees, alas!
  That unhappy Figure near him,
  Limping oer the dewy grass,                                     
  Where the road it fringes, sweet,
  Soft and cool to way-worn feet;
  And, O indignity! an Ass,
  By his noble Mastiffs side,
  Tethered to the waggons tail:                                   
  And the ship, in all her pride,
  Following after in full sail!
  Not to speak of babe and mother;
  Who, contented with each other,
  And snug as birds in leafy arbour,                               
  Find, within, a blessed harbour!

    With eager eyes the Master pries;
  Looks in and out, and through and through;
  Says nothing till at last he spies
  A wound upon the Mastiffs head,                                 
  A wound, where plainly might be read
  What feats an Ass hoof can do!
  But drop the rest this aggravation,
  This complicated provocation,
  A hoard of grievances unsealed;                                  
  All past forgiveness it repealed;
  And thus, and through distempered blood
  On both sides, Benjamin the good,
  The patient, and the tender hearted,
  Was from his team and waggon parted;                             
  When duty of that day was oer,
  Laid down his whip and served no more.
  Nor could the waggon long survive,
  Which Benjamin had ceased to drive:
  It lingered on guide after guide                               
  Ambitiously the office tried;
  But each unmanageable hill
  Called for his patience and his skill
  And sure it is, that through this night,
  And what the morning brought to light,                           
  Two losses had we to sustain,
  We lost both WAGGONER and WAIN!

  Accept, O Friend, for praise or blame,
  The gift of this adventurous song;
  A record which I dared to frame,                                 
  Though timid scruples checked me long;
  They checked me and I left the theme
  Untouched in spite of many a gleam
  Of fancy which thereon was shed,
  Like pleasant sunbeams shifting still                            
  Upon the side of a distant hill
  But Nature might not be gainsaid;
  For what I have and what I miss
  I sing of these it makes my bliss!
  Nor is it I who play the part,                                  
  But a shy spirit in my heart,
  That comes and goes will sometimes leap
  From hiding places ten years deep;
  Or haunts me with familiar face, 
  Returning, like a ghost unlaid,                                 
  Until the debt I owe be paid.
  Forgive me, then for I had been
  On friendly terms with this Machine: 
  In him, while he was wont to trace
  Our roads, through many a long years space,                     
  A living almanack had we;
  We had a speaking diary,
  That in this uneventful place,
  Gave to the days a mark and name
  By which we knew them when they came.                            
Yes, I, and all about me here,
  Through all the changes of the year,
  Had seen him through the mountains go,
  In pomp of mist or pomp of snow,
  Majestically huge and slow:                                      
  Or, with a milder grace adorning
  The landscape of a summers morning;
  While Grasmere smoothed her liquid plain
  The moving image to detain;
  And mighty Fairfield, with a chime                               
  Of echoes, to his march kept time;
  When little other business stirred,
  And little other sound was heard;
  In that delicious hour of balm,
  Stillness, solitude, and calm,                                   
  While yet the valley is arrayed,
  On this side with a sober shade;
  On that is prodigally bright
  Crag, lawn, and wood with rosy light.
But most of all, thou lordly Wain!                             
  I wish to have thee here again,
  When windows flap and chimney roars,
  And all is dismal out of doors;
  And, sitting by my fire, I see
  Eight sorry carts, no less a train!                              
  Unworthy successors of thee,
  Come straggling through the wind and rain:
  And oft, as they pass slowly on,
  Beneath my windows, one by one,
  See, perched upon the naked height                               
  The summit of a cumbrous freight,
  A single traveller and there
  Another; then perhaps a pair
  The lame, the sickly, and the old;
  Men, women, heartless with the cold;                             
  And babes in wet and starveling plight;
  Which once, be weather as it might,
  Had still a nest within a nest,
  Thy shelter and their mother's breast!
  Then most of all, then far the most,                             
  Do I regret what we have lost;
  Am grieved for that unhappy sin
  Which robbed us of good Benjamin;
  And of his stately Charge, which none
  Could keep alive when He was gone!
