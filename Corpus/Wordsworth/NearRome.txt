Long has the dew been dried on tree and lawn;
    Oâ€™er man and beast a not unwelcome boon
    Is shed, the languor of approaching noon;
    To shady rest withdrawing or withdrawn
    Mute are all creatures, as this couchant fawn,                     
    Save insect-swarms that hum in air afloat,
    Save that the Cock is crowing, a shrill note,
    Startling and shrill as that which roused the dawn.
    --Heard in that hour, or when, as now, the nerve
    Shrinks from the note as from a mis-timed thing,             
    Oft for a holy warning may it serve,
    Charged with remembrance of _his_ sudden sting,
    His bitter tears, whose name the Papal Chair
    And yon resplendent Church are proud to bear.
