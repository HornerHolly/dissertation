Not utterly unworthy to endure
    Was the supremacy of crafty Rome;
    Age after age to the arch of Christendom
    AÃ«rial keystone haughtily secure;
    Supremacy from Heaven transmitted pure,                            
    As many hold; and, therefore, to the tomb
    Pass, some through fire--and by the scaffold some--
    Like saintly Fisher, and unbending More.
    "Lightly for both the bosom's lord did sit
    Upon his throne;" unsoftened, undismayed                     
    By aught that mingled with the tragic scene
    Of pity or fear; and More's gay genius played
    With the inoffensive sword of native wit,
    Than the bare axe more luminous and keen.
