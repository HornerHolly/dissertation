Fear hath a hundred eyes that all agree
    To plague her beating heart; and there is one
    (Nor idlest that!) which holds communion
    With things that were not, yet were _meant_ to be.
    Aghast within its gloomy cavity                                    
    That eye (which sees as if fulfilled and done
    Crimes that might stop the motion of the sun)
    Beholds the horrible catastrophe
    Of an assembled Senate unredeemed
    From subterraneous Treason's darkling power:                      
    Merciless act of sorrow infinite!
    Worse than the product of that dismal night,
    When gushing, copious as a thunder-shower,
    The blood of Huguenots through Paris streamed.
