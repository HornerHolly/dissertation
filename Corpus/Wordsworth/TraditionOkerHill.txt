'Tis said that to the brow of yon fair hill
    Two Brothers clomb, and, turning face from face,
    Nor one look more exchanging, grief to still
    Or feed, each planted on that lofty place
    A chosen Tree; then, eager to fulfil                          
    Their courses, like two new-born rivers, they
    In opposite directions urged their way
    Down from the far-seen mount. No blast might kill
    Or blight that fond memorial;--the trees grew,
    And now entwine their arms; but ne'er again                       
    Embraced those Brothers upon earth's wide plain;
    Nor aught of mutual joy or sorrow knew
    Until their spirits mingled in the sea
    That to itself takes all, Eternity.
