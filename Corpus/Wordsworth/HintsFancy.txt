On, loitering Muse--the swift Stream chides us--on!
    Albeit his deep-worn channel doth immure
    Objects immense portrayed in miniature,
    Wild shapes for many a strange comparison!
    Niagaras, Alpine passes, and anon                              
    Abodes of Naiads, calm abysses pure,
    Bright liquid mansions, fashioned to endure
    When the broad oak drops, a leafless skeleton,
    And the solidities of mortal pride,
    Palace and tower, are crumbled into dust!--                   
    The Bard who walks with Duddon for his guide,
    Shall find such toys of fancy thickly set:
    Turn from the sight, enamoured Muse--we must;
    And, if thou canst, leave them without regret!
