   Sole listener, Duddon! to the breeze that played
    With thy clear voice, I caught the fitful sound
    Wafted o'er sullen moss and craggy mound--
    Unfruitful solitudes, that seemed to upbraid
    The sun in heaven!--but now, to form a shade                   
    For Thee, green alders have together wound
    Their foliage; ashes flung their arms around;
    And birch-trees risen in silver colonnade.
    And thou hast also tempted here to rise,
    'Mid sheltering pines, this Cottage rude and grey;            
    Whose ruddy children, by the mother's eyes
    Carelessly watched, sport through the summer day,
    Thy pleased associates:--light as endless May
    On infant bosoms lonely Nature lies.
