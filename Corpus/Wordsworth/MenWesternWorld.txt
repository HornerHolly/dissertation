  Men of the Western World! in Fate’s dark book
    Whence these opprobrious leaves of dire portent?
    Think ye your British Ancestors forsook
    Their native Land, for outrage provident;
    From unsubmissive necks the bridle shook                           
    To give, in their Descendants, freer vent
    And wider range to passions turbulent,
    To mutual tyranny a deadlier look?
    Nay, said a voice, soft as the south wind’s breath,
    Dive through the stormy surface of the flood                      
    To the great current flowing underneath;
    Explore the countless springs of silent good;
    So shall the truth be better understood,
    And thy grieved Spirit brighten strong in faith.
