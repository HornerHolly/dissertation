 Not the whole warbling grove in concert heard
    When sunshine follows shower, the breast can thrill
    Like the first summons, Cuckoo! of thy bill,
    With its twin notes inseparably paired.
    The captive 'mid damp vaults unsunned, unaired,                    
    Measuring the periods of his lonely doom,
    That cry can reach; and to the sick man's room
    Sends gladness, by no languid smile declared.
    The lordly eagle-race through hostile search
    May perish; time may come when never more                         
    The wilderness shall hear the lion roar;
    But, long as cock shall crow from household perch
    To rouse the dawn, soft gales shall speed thy wing,
    And thy erratic voice be faithful to the Spring!
