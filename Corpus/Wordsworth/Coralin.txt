 Lord of the vale! astounding Flood;
    The dullest leaf in this thick wood
    Quakes--conscious of thy power;
    The caves reply with hollow moan;
    And vibrates, to its central stone,                            
    Yon time-cemented Tower!

    And yet how fair the rural scene!
    For thou, O Clyde, hast ever been
    Beneficent as strong;
    Pleased in refreshing dews to steep                           
    The little trembling flowers that peep
    Thy shelving rocks among.

    Hence all who love their country, love
    To look on thee--delight to rove
    Where they thy voice can hear;                                
    And, to the patriot-warrior's Shade,
    Lord of the vale! to Heroes laid
    In dust, that voice is dear!

    Along thy banks, at dead of night
    Sweeps visibly the Wallace Wight;                             
    Or stands, in warlike vest,
    Aloft, beneath the moon's pale beam,
    A Champion worthy of the stream,
    Yon grey tower's living crest!

    But clouds and envious darkness hide                          
    A Form not doubtfully descried:--
    Their transient mission o'er,
    O say to what blind region flee
    These Shapes of awful phantasy?
    To what untrodden shore?                                      

    Less than divine command they spurn;
    But this we from the mountains learn,
    And this the valleys show;
    That never will they deign to hold
    Communion where the heart is cold                             
    To human weal and woe.

    The man of abject soul in vain
    Shall walk the Marathonian plain;
    Or thrid the shadowy gloom,
    That still invests the guardian Pass,                         
    Where stood, sublime, Leonidas
    Devoted to the tomb.

    And let no Slave his head incline,
    Or kneel, before the votive shrine
    By Uri's lake, where Tell                                     
    Leapt, from his storm-vext boat, to land,
    Heaven's Instrument, for by his hand
    That day the Tyrant fell.
