 The Young-ones gathered in from hill and dale,
    With holiday delight on every brow:
    'Tis passed away; far other thoughts prevail;
    For they are taking the baptismal Vow
    Upon their conscious selves; their own lips speak                  
    The solemn promise. Strongest sinews fail,
    And many a blooming, many a lovely, cheek
    Under the holy fear of God turns pale;
    While on each head his lawn-robed servant lays
    An apostolic hand, and with prayer seals                          
    The Covenant. The Omnipotent will raise
    Their feeble Souls; and bear with _his_ regrets,
    Who, looking round the fair assemblage, feels
    That ere the Sun goes down their childhood sets.
