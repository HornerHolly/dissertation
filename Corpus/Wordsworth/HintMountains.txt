  "Who but hails the sight with pleasure
    When the wings of genius rise,
    Their ability to measure
       With great enterprise;
    But in man was ne'er such daring                               
    As yon Hawk exhibits, pairing
    His brave spirit with the war in
       The stormy skies!

    "Mark him, how his power he uses,
    Lays it by, at will resumes!                                  
    Mark, ere for his haunt he chooses
       Clouds and utter glooms!
    There, he wheels in downward mazes;
    Sunward now his flight he raises,
    Catches fire, as seems, and blazes                            
       With uninjured plumes!"--
