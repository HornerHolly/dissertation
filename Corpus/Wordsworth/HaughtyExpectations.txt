 When haughty expectations prostrate lie,
    And grandeur crouches like a guilty thing,
    Oft shall the lowly weak, till nature bring
    Mature release, in fair society
    Survive, and Fortune's utmost anger try;                       
    Like these frail snow-drops that together cling,
    And nod their helmets, smitten by the wing
    Of many a furious whirl-blast sweeping by.
    Observe the faithful flowers! if small to great
    May lead the thoughts, thus struggling used to stand
    The Emathian phalanx, nobly obstinate;                    
    And so the bright immortal Theban band,
    Whom onset, fiercely urged at Jove's command,
    Might overwhelm, but could not separate!
