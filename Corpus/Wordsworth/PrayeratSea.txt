To kneeling Worshippers no earthly floor
    Gives holier invitation than the deck
    Of a storm-shattered Vessel saved from Wreck
    (When all that Man could do avail'd no more)
    By him who raised the Tempest and restrains:                       
    Happy the crew who this have felt, and pour
    Forth for his mercy, as the Church ordains,
    Solemn thanksgiving. Nor will _they_ implore
    In vain who, for a rightful cause, give breath
    To words the Church prescribes aiding the lip                     
    For the heart's sake, ere ship with hostile ship
    Encounters, armed for work of pain and death.
    Suppliants! the God to whom your cause ye trust
    Will listen, and ye know that He is just.
