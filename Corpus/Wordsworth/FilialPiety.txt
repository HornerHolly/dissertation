 Untouched through all severity of cold;
    Inviolate, whate'er the cottage hearth
    Might need for comfort, or for festal mirth;
    That Pile of Turf is half a century old:
    Yes, Traveller! fifty winters have been told                       
    Since suddenly the dart of death went forth
    'Gainst him who raised it,--his last work on earth:
    Thence has it, with the Son, so strong a hold
    Upon his Father's memory, that his hands,
    Through reverence, touch it only to repair     
    Its waste.--Though crumbling with each breath of air,
    In annual renovation thus it stands--
    Rude Mausoleum! but wrens nestle there,
    And red-breasts warble when sweet sounds are rare.
