 The imperial Consort of the Fairy-king
    Owns not a sylvan bower; or gorgeous cell
    With emerald floored, and with purpureal shell
    Ceilinged and roofed; that is so fair a thing
    As this low structure, for the tasks of Spring,                
    Prepared by one who loves the buoyant swell
    Of the brisk waves, yet here consents to dwell;
    And spreads in steadfast peace her brooding wing.
    Words cannot paint the oershadowing yew tree bough,
    And dimly gleaming Nest, a hollow crown                      
    Of golden leaves inlaid with silver down,
    Fine as the mother's softest plumes allow:
    I gazed and, self accused while gazing, sighed
    For human-kind, weak slaves of cumbrous pride!
