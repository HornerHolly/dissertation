"Farewell, deep Valley, with thy one rude House,
    And its small lot of life-supporting fields,
    And guardian rocks!--Farewell, attractive seat!
    To the still influx of the morning light
    Open, and day's pure cheerfulness, but veiled            
    From human observation, as if yet
    Primeval forests wrapped thee round with dark
    Impenetrable shade; once more farewell,
    Majestic circuit, beautiful abyss,
    By Nature destined from the birth of things                   
    For quietness profound!"
                              Upon the side
    Of that brown ridge, sole outlet of the vale
    Which foot of boldest stranger would attempt,
    Lingering behind my comrades, thus I breathed
    A parting tribute to a spot that seemed                       
    Like the fixed centre of a troubled world.
    Again I halted with reverted eyes;
    The chain that would not slacken, was at length
    Snapt,--and, pursuing leisurely my way,
    How vain, thought I, is it by change of place
    To seek that comfort which the mind denies;
    Yet trial and temptation oft are shunned
    Wisely; and by such tenure do we hold
    Frail life's possessions, that even they whose fate
    Yields no peculiar reason of complaint                        
    Might, by the promise that is here, be won
    To steal from active duties, and embrace
    Obscurity, and undisturbed repose.
    --Knowledge, methinks, in these disordered times,
    Should be allowed a privilege to have                         
    Her anchorites, like piety of old;
    Men, who, from faction sacred, and unstained
    By war, might, if so minded, turn aside
    Uncensured, and subsist, a scattered few
    Living to God and nature, and content                         
    With that communion. Consecrated be
    The spots where such abide! But happier still
    The Man, whom, furthermore, a hope attends
    That meditation and research may guide
    His privacy to principles and powers                          
    Discovered or invented; or set forth,
    Through his acquaintance with the ways of truth,
    In lucid order; so that, when his course
    Is run, some faithful eulogist may say,
    He sought not praise, and praise did overlook                 
    His unobtrusive merit; but his life,
    Sweet to himself, was exercised in good
    That shall survive his name and memory.

      Acknowledgments of gratitude sincere
    Accompanied these musings; fervent thanks                     
    For my own peaceful lot and happy choice;
    A choice that from the passions of the world
    Withdrew, and fixed me in a still retreat;
    Sheltered, but not to social duties lost,
    Secluded, but not buried; and with song                       
    Cheering my days, and with industrious thought;
    With the ever-welcom company of books;
    With virtuous friendship's soul-sustaining aid,
    And with the blessings of domestic love.

      Thus occupied in mind I paced along,                       
    Following the rugged road, by sledge or wheel
    Worn in the moorland, till I overtook
    My two Associates, in the morning sunshine
    Halting together on a rocky knoll,
    Whence the bare road descended rapidly                   
    To the green meadows of another vale.

      Here did our pensive Host put forth his hand
    In sign of farewell. "Nay," the old Man said,
    "The fragrant air its coolness still retains;
    The herds and flocks are yet abroad to crop                  
    The dewy grass; you cannot leave us now,
    We must not part at this inviting hour."
    He yielded, though reluctant; for his mind
    Instinctively disposed him to retire
    To his own covert; as a billow, heaved                        
    Upon the beach, rolls back into the sea.
    --So we descend: and winding round a rock
    Attain a point that showed the valley--stretched
    In length before us; and, not distant far,
    Upon a rising ground a grey church-tower
    Whose battlements were screened by tufted trees.
    And towards a crystal Mere, that lay beyond
    Among steep hills and woods embosomed, flowed
    A copious stream with boldly-winding course;
    Here traceable, there hidden--there again                    
    To sight restored, and glittering in the sun.
    On the stream's bank, and every where, appeared
    Fair dwellings, single, or in social knots;
    Some scattered o'er the level, others perched
    On the hill sides, a cheerful quiet scene,                   
    Now in its morning purity arrayed.

      "As 'mid some happy valley of the Alps,"
    Said I, "once happy, ere tyrannic power,
    Wantonly breaking in upon the Swiss,
    Destroyed their unoffending commonwealth,                     
    A popular equality reigns here,
    Save for yon stately House beneath whose roof
    A rural lord might dwell."--"No feudal pomp,
    Or power," replied the Wanderer, "to that House
    Belongs, but there in his allotted Home                      
    Abides, from year to year, a genuine Priest,
    The shepherd of his flock; or, as a king
    Is styled, when most affectionately praised,
    The father of his people. Such is he;
    And rich and poor, and young and old, rejoice                
    Under his spiritual sway. He hath vouchsafed
    To me some portion of a kind regard;
    And something also of his inner mind
    Hath he imparted--but I speak of him
    As he is known to all.
                            The calm delights                    
    Of unambitious piety he chose,
    And learning's solid dignity; though born
    Of knightly race, nor wanting powerful friends.
    Hither, in prime of manhood, he withdrew
    From academic bowers. He loved the spot--                    
    Who does not love his native soil?--he prized
    The ancient rural character, composed
    Of simple manners, feelings unsupprest
    And undisguised, and strong and serious thought;
    A character reflected in himself,                            
    With such embellishment as well beseems
    His rank and sacred function. This deep vale
    Winds far in reaches hidden from our sight,
    And one a turreted manorial hall
    Adorns, in which the good Man's ancestors                    
    Have dwelt through ages--Patrons of this Cure.
    To them, and to his own judicious pains,
    The Vicar's dwelling, and the whole domain,
    Owes that presiding aspect which might well
    Attract your notice; statelier than could else               
    Have been bestowed, through course of common chance,
    On an unwealthy mountain Benefice."

      This said, oft pausing, we pursued our way;
    Nor reached the village-churchyard till the sun
    Travelling at steadier pace than ours, had risen             
    Above the summits of the highest hills,
    And round our path darted oppressive beams.

      As chanced, the portals of the sacred Pile
    Stood open; and we entered. On my frame,
    At such transition from the fervid air,                      
    A grateful coolness fell, that seemed to strike
    The heart, in concert with that temperate awe
    And natural reverence which the place inspired.
    Not raised in nice proportions was the pile;
    But large and massy; for duration built;                     
    With pillars crowded, and the roof upheld
    By naked rafters intricately crossed,
    Like leafless underboughs, in some thick wood,
    All withered by the depth of shade above.
    Admonitory texts inscribed the walls,                        
    Each, in its ornamental scroll, enclosed;
    Each also crowned with winged heads--a pair
    Of rudely-painted Cherubim. The floor
    Of nave and aisle, in unpretending guise,
    Was occupied by oaken benches ranged                         
    In seemly rows; the chancel only showed
    Some vain distinctions, marks of earthly state
    By immemorial privilege allowed;
    Though with the Encincture's special sanctity
    But ill according. An heraldic shield,                       
    Varying its tincture with the changeful light,
    Imbued the altar-window; fixed aloft
    A faded hatchment hung, and one by time
    Yet undiscoloured. A capacious pew
    Of sculptured oak stood here, with drapery lined;            
    And marble monuments were here displayed
    Thronging the walls; and on the floor beneath
    Sepulchral stones appeared, with emblems graven
    And foot-worn epitaphs, and some with small
    And shining effigies of brass inlaid.

      The tribute by these various records claimed,
    Duly we paid, each after each, and read
    The ordinary chronicle of birth,
    Office, alliance, and promotion--all
    Ending in dust; of upright magistrates,                      
    Grave doctors strenuous for the mother-church,
    And uncorrupted senators, alike
    To king and people true. A brazen plate,
    Not easily deciphered, told of one
    Whose course of earthly honour was begun                     
    In quality of page among the train
    Of the eighth Henry, when he crossed the seas
    His royal state to show, and prove his strength
    In tournament, upon the fields of France.
    Another tablet registered the death,                         
    And praised the gallant bearing, of a Knight
    Tried in the sea-fights of the second Charles.
    Near this brave Knight his father lay entombed;
    And, to the silent language giving voice,
    I read,--how in his manhood's earlier day                    
    He, 'mid the afflictions of intestine war,
    And rightful government subverted, found
    One only solace--that he had espoused
    A virtuous Lady tenderly beloved
    For her benign perfections; and yet more                     
    Endeared to him, for this, that, in her state
    Of wedlock richly crowned with Heaven's regard,
    She with a numerous issue filled his house,
    Who throve, like plants, uninjured by the storm
    That laid their country waste. No need to speak              
    Of less particular notices assigned
    To Youth or Maiden gone before their time,
    And Matrons and unwedded Sisters old;
    Whose charity and goodness were rehearsed
    In modest panegyric.
                          "These dim lines,                      
    What would they tell?" said I,--but, from the task
    Of puzzling out that faded narrative,
    With whisper soft my venerable Friend
    Called me; and, looking down the darksome aisle,
    I saw the Tenant of the lonely vale                          
    Standing apart; with curvèd arm reclined
    On the baptismal font; his pallid face
    Upturned, as if his mind were rapt, or lost
    In some abstraction; gracefully he stood,
    The semblance bearing of a sculptured form                   
    That leans upon a monumental urn
    In peace, from morn to night, from year to year.

      Him from that posture did the Sexton rouse;
    Who entered, humming carelessly a tune,
    Continuation haply of the notes                              
    That had beguiled the work from which he came,
    With spade and mattock o'er his shoulder hung;
    To be deposited, for future need,
    In their appointed place. The pale Recluse
    Withdrew; and straight we followed,--to a spot               
    Where sun and shade were intermixed; for there
    A broad oak, stretching forth its leafy arms
    From an adjoining pasture, overhung
    Small space of that green churchyard with a light
    And pleasant awning. On the moss-grown wall              
    My ancient Friend and I together took
    Our seats; and thus the Solitary spake,
    Standing before us:--
                           "Did you note the mien
    Of that self-solaced, easy-hearted churl,                    
    Death's hireling, who scoops out his neighbour's grave,
    Or wraps an old acquaintance up in clay,
    All unconcerned as he would bind a sheaf,
    Or plant a tree. And did you hear his voice?
    I was abruptly summoned by the sound
    From some affecting images and thoughts,                     
    Which then were silent; but crave utterance now.

      "Much," he continued, with dejected look,
    "Much, yesterday, was said in glowing phrase
    Of our sublime dependencies, and hopes
    For future states of being; and the wings                    
    Of speculation, joyfully outspread,
    Hovered above our destiny on earth:
    But stoop, and place the prospect of the soul
    In sober contrast with reality,
    And man's substantial life. If this mute earth               
    Of what it holds could speak, and every grave
    Were as a volume, shut, yet capable
    Of yielding its contents to eye and ear,
    We should recoil, stricken with sorrow and shame,
    To see disclosed, by such dread proof, how ill               
    That which is done accords with what is known
    To reason, and by conscience is enjoined;
    How idly, how perversely, life's whole course,
    To this conclusion, deviates from the line,
    Or of the end stops short, proposed to all                   
    At her aspiring outset.
                                "Mark the babe
    Not long accustomed to this breathing world;
    One that hath barely learned to shape a smile,
    Though yet irrational of soul, to grasp
    With tiny finger to let fall a tear;                   
    And, as the heavy cloud of sleep dissolves,
    To stretch his limbs, bemocking, as might seem,
    The outward functions of intelligent man;
    A grave proficient in amusive feats
    Of puppetry, that from the lap declare                       
    His expectations, and announce his claims
    To that inheritance which millions rue
    That they were ever born to! In due time
    A day of solemn ceremonial comes;
    When they, who for this Minor hold in trust                  
    Rights that transcend the loftiest heritage
    Of mere humanity, present their Charge,
    For this occasion daintily adorned,
    At the baptismal font. And when the pure
    And consecrating element hath cleansed                       
    The original stain, the child is there received
    Into the second ark, Christ's church, with trust
    That he, from wrath redeemed, therein shall float
    Over the billows of this troublesome world
    To the fair land of everlasting life.                        
    Corrupt affections, covetous desires,
    Are all renounced; high as the thought of man
    Can carry virtue, virtue is professed;
    A dedication made, a promise given
    For due provision to control and guide,                      
    And unremitting progress to ensure
    In holiness and truth."
                             "You cannot blame,"
    Here interposing fervently I said,
    "Rites which attest that Man by nature lies
    Bedded for good and evil in a gulf                           
    Fearfully low; nor will your judgment scorn
    Those services, whereby attempt is made
    To lift the creature toward that eminence
    On which, now fallen, erewhile in majesty
    He stood; or if not so, whose top serene                     
    At least he feels 'tis given him to descry;
    Not without aspirations, evermore
    Returning, and injunctions from within
    Doubt to cast off and weariness; in trust
    That what the Soul perceives, if glory lost,                 
    May be, through pains and persevering hope,
    Recovered; or, if hitherto unknown,
    Lies within reach, and one day shall be gained."

      "I blame them not," he calmly answered--"no;
    The outward ritual and established forms                     
    With which communities of men invest
    These inward feelings, and the aspiring vows
    To which the lips give public utterance
    Are both a natural process; and by me
    Shall pass uncensured; though the issue prove,               
    Bringing from age to age its own reproach,
    Incongruous, impotent, and blank.--But, oh!
    If to be weak is to be wretched--miserable,
    As the lost Angel by a human voice
    Hath mournfully pronounced, then, in my mind,                
    Far better not to move at all than move
    By impulse sent from such illusive power,--
    That finds and cannot fasten down; that grasps
    And is rejoiced, and loses while it grasps;
    That tempts, emboldens--for a time sustains,
    And then betrays; accuses and inflicts
    Remorseless punishment; and so retreads
    The inevitable circle; better far
    Than this, to graze the herb in thoughtless peace,
    By foresight or remembrance, undisturbed!                    

      "Philosophy! and thou more vaunted name
    Religion! with thy statelier retinue,
    Faith, Hope, and Charity--from the visible world
    Choose for your emblems whatsoe'er ye find
    Of safest guidance or of firmest trust--                
    The torch, the star, the anchor; nor except
    The cross itself, at whose unconscious feet
    The generations of mankind have knelt
    Ruefully seized, and shedding bitter tears,
    And through that conflict seeking rest--of you,              
    High-titled Powers, am I constrained to ask,
    Here standing, with the unvoyageable sky
    In faint reflection of infinitude
    Stretched overhead, and at my pensive feet
    A subterraneous magazine of bones,                           
    In whose dark vaults my own shall soon be laid,
    Where are your triumphs? your dominion where?
    And in what age admitted and confirmed?
    --Not for a happy land do I enquire,
    Island or grove, that hides a blessed few                    
    Who, with obedience willing and sincere,
    To your serene authorities conform;
    But whom, I ask, of individual Souls,
    Have ye withdrawn from passion's crooked ways,
    Inspired, and thoroughly fortified?--If the heart            
    Could be inspected to its inmost folds
    By sight undazzled with the glare of praise,
    Who shall be named--in the resplendent line
    Of sages, martyrs, confessors--the man
    Whom the best might of faith, wherever fix'd,
    For one day's little compass, has preserved
    From painful and discreditable shocks
    Of contradiction, from some vague desire
    Culpably cherished, or corrupt relapse
    To some unsanctioned fear?"
                                "If this be so,                  
    And Man," said I, "be in his noblest shape
    Thus pitiably infirm; then, he who made,
    And who shall judge the creature, will forgive.
    --Yet, in its general tenor, your complaint
    Is all too true; and surely not misplaced:                   
    For, from this pregnant spot of ground, such thoughts
    Rise to the notice of a serious mind
    By natural exhalation. With the dead
    In their repose, the living in their mirth,
    Who can reflect, unmoved, upon the round                     
    Of smooth and solemnized complacencies,
    By which, on Christian lands, from age to age
    Profession mocks performance? Earth is sick,
    And Heaven is weary, of the hollow words
    Which States and Kingdoms utter when they talk               
    Of truth and justice. Turn to private life
    And social neighbourhood; look we to ourselves;
    A light of duty shines on every day
    For all; and yet how few are warmed or cheered!
    How few who mingle with their fellow-men                     
    And still remain self-governed, and apart,
    Like this our honoured Friend; and thence acquire
    Right to expect his vigorous decline,
    That promises to the end a blest old age!"

      "Yet," with a smile of triumph thus exclaimed              
    The Solitary, "in the life of man,
    If to the poetry of common speech
    Faith may be given, we see as in a glass
    A true reflection of the circling year,
    With all its seasons. Grant that Spring is there,            
    In spite of many a rough untoward blast,
    Hopeful and promising with buds and flowers;
    Yet where is glowing Summer's long rich day,
    That _ought_ to follow faithfully expressed?
    And mellow Autumn, charged with bounteous fruit,             
    Where is she imaged? in what favoured clime
    Her lavish pomp, and ripe magnificence?
    --Yet, while the better part is missed, the worse
    In man's autumnal season is set forth
    With a resemblance not to be denied,                         
    And that contents him; bowers that hear no more
    The voice of gladness, less and less supply
    Of outward sunshine and internal warmth;
    And, with this change, sharp air and falling leaves,
    Foretelling aged Winter's desolate sway.

      "How gay the habitations that bedeck
    This fertile valley! Not a house but seems
    To give assurance of content within;
    Embosomed happiness, and placid love;
    As if the sunshine of the day were met                       
    With answering brightness in the hearts of all
    Who walk this favoured ground. But chance-regards,
    And notice forced upon incurious ears;
    These, if these only, acting in despite
    Of the encomiums by my Friend pronounced                     
    On humble life, forbid the judging mind
    To trust the smiling aspect of this fair
    And noiseless commonwealth. The simple race
    Of mountaineers (by nature's self removed
    From foul temptations, and by constant care                  
    Of a good shepherd tended as themselves
    Do tend their flocks) partake man's general lot
    With little mitigation. They escape,
    Perchance, the heavier woes of guilt; feel not
    The tedium of fantastic idleness:                            
    Yet life, as with the multitude, with them
    Is fashioned like an ill-constructed tale;
    That on the outset wastes its gay desires,
    Its fair adventures, its enlivening hopes,
    And pleasant interests--for the sequel leaving               
    Old things repeated with diminished grace;
    And all the laboured novelties at best
    Imperfect substitutes, whose use and power
    Evince the want and weakness whence they spring."

      While in this serious mood we held discourse,              
    The reverend Pastor toward the church-yard gate
    Approached; and, with a mild respectful air
    Of native cordiality, our Friend
    Advanced to greet him. With a gracious mien
    Was he received, and mutual joy prevailed.                   
    Awhile they stood in conference, and I guess
    That he, who now upon the mossy wall
    Sate by my side, had vanished, if a wish
    Could have transferred him to the flying clouds,
    Or the least penetrable hiding-place                         
    In his own valley's rocky guardianship.
    --For me, I looked upon the pair, well pleased:
    Nature had framed them both, and both were marked
    By circumstance, with intermixture fine
    Of contrast and resemblance. To an oak                       
    Hardy and grand, a weather-beaten oak,
    Fresh in the strength and majesty of age,
    One might be likened: flourishing appeared,
    Though somewhat past the fulness of his prime,
    The other--like a stately sycamore,
    That spreads, in gentle pomp, its honied shade.

      A general greeting was exchanged; and soon
    The Pastor learned that his approach had given
    A welcome interruption to discourse
    Grave, and in truth too often sad.--"Is Man             
    A child of hope? Do generations press
    On generations, without progress made?
    Halts the individual, ere his hairs be grey,
    Perforce? Are we a creature in whom good
    Preponderates, or evil? Doth the will                        
    Acknowledge reason's law? A living power
    Is virtue, or no better than a name,
    Fleeting as health or beauty, and unsound?
    So that the only substance which remains,
    (For thus the tenor of complaint hath run)                   
    Among so many shadows, are the pains
    And penalties of miserable life,
    Doomed to decay, and then expire in dust!
    --Our cogitations this way have been drawn,                  
    These are the points," the Wanderer said, "on which
    Our inquest turns.--Accord, good Sir! the light
    Of your experience to dispel this gloom:
    By your persuasive wisdom shall the heart
    That frets, or languishes, be stilled and cheered.

      "Our nature," said the Priest, in mild reply,              
    "Angels may weigh and fathom: they perceive,
    With undistempered and unclouded spirit,
    The object as it is; but, for ourselves,
    That speculative height _we_ may not reach.
    The good and evil are our own; and we                        
    Are that which we would contemplate from far.
    Knowledge, for us, is difficult to gain--
    Is difficult to gain, and hard to keep--
    As virtue's self; like virtue is beset
    With snares; tried, tempted, subject to decay.               
    Love, admiration, fear, desire, and hate,
    Blind were we without these; through these alone
    Are capable to notice or discern
    Or to record; we judge, but cannot be
    Indifferent judges. 'Spite of proudest boast,                
    Reason, best reason, is to imperfect man
    An effort only, and a noble aim;
    A crown, an attribute of sovereign power,
    Still to be courted--never to be won.
    --Look forth, or each man dive into himself;                 
    What sees he but a creature too perturbed;
    That is transported to excess; that yearns,
    Regrets, or trembles, wrongly, or too much;
    Hopes rashly, in disgust as rash recoils;
    Battens on spleen, or moulders in despair?                   
    Thus comprehension fails, and truth is missed;
    Thus darkness and delusion round our path
    Spread, from disease, whose subtle injury lurks
    Within the very faculty of sight.

      "Yet for the general purposes of faith                     
    In Providence, for solace and support,
    We may not doubt that who can best subject
    The will to reason's law, can strictliest live
    And act in that obedience, he shall gain
    The clearest apprehension of those truths,                   
    Which unassisted reason's utmost power
    Is too infirm to reach. But, waiving this,
    And our regards confining within bounds
    Of less exalted consciousness, through which
    The very multitude are free to range,                        
    We safely may affirm that human life
    Is either fair and tempting, a soft scene
    Grateful to sight, refreshing to the soul,
    Or a forbidden tract of cheerless view;
    Even as the same is looked at, or approached.                
    Thus, when in changeful April fields are white
    With new-fallen snow, if from the sullen north
    Your walk conduct you hither, ere the sun
    Hath gained his noontide height, this churchyard, filled
    With mounds transversely lying side by side             
    From east to west, before you will appear
    An unillumined, blank, and dreary, plain,
    With more than wintry cheerlessness and gloom
    Saddening the heart. Go forward, and look back;
    Look, from the quarter whence the lord of light,        
    Of life, of love, and gladness doth dispense
    His beams; which, unexcluded in their fall,
    Upon the southern side of every grave
    Have gently exercised a melting power;
    _Then_ will a vernal prospect greet your eye,                
    All fresh and beautiful, and green and bright,
    Hopeful and cheerful:--vanished is the pall
    That overspread and chilled the sacred turf,
    Vanished or hidden; and the whole domain,
    To some, too lightly minded, might appear                    
    A meadow carpet for the dancing hours.
    --This contrast, not unsuitable to life,
    Is to that other state more apposite,
    Death and its two-fold aspect! wintry--one,
    Cold, sullen, blank, from hope and joy shut out;             
    The other, which the ray divine hath touched,
    Replete with vivid promise, bright as spring."

      "We see, then, as we feel," the Wanderer thus
    With a complacent animation spake,
    "And in your judgment, Sir! the mind's repose                
    On evidence is not to be ensured
    By act of naked reason. Moral truth
    Is no mechanic structure, built by rule;
    And which, once built, retains a stedfast shape
    And undisturbed proportions; but a thing                     
    Subject, you deem, to vital accidents;
    And, like the water-lily, lives and thrives,
    Whose root is fixed in stable earth, whose head
    Floats on the tossing waves. With joy sincere
    I re-salute these sentiments confirmed                       
    By your authority. But how acquire
    The inward principle that gives effect
    To outward argument; the passive will
    Meek to admit; the active energy,
    Strong and unbounded to embrace, and firm                    
    To keep and cherish? how shall man unite
    With self-forgetting tenderness of heart
    An earth-despising dignity of soul?
    Wise in that union, and without it blind!"

      "The way," said I, "to court, if not obtain                
    The ingenuous mind, apt to be set aright;
    This, in the lonely dell discoursing, you
    Declared at large; and by what exercise
    From visible nature, or the inner self
    Power may be trained, and renovation brought                 
    To those who need the gift. But, after all,
    Is aught so certain as that man is doomed
    To breathe beneath a vault of ignorance?
    The natural roof of that dark house in which
    His soul is pent! How little can be known--                  
    This is the wise man's sigh; how far we err--
    This is the good man's not unfrequent pang!
    And they perhaps err least, the lowly class
    Whom a benign necessity compels
    To follow reason's least ambitious course;                   
    Such do I mean who, unperplexed by doubt,
    And unincited by a wish to look
    Into high objects farther than they may,
    Pace to and fro, from morn till even-tide,
    The narrow avenue of daily toil                              
    For daily bread."
                       "Yes," buoyantly exclaimed
    The pale Recluse--"praise to the sturdy plough,
    And patient spade; praise to the simple crook,
    And ponderous loom--resounding while it holds
    Body and mind in one captivity;                              
    And let the light mechanic tool be hailed
    With honour; which, encasing by the power
    Of long companionship, the artist's hand,
    Cuts off that hand, with all its world of nerves,
    From a too busy commerce with the heart!                     
    --Inglorious implements of craft and toil,
    Both ye that shape and build, and ye that force,
    By slow solicitation, earth to yield
    Her annual bounty, sparingly dealt forth
    With wise reluctance; you would I extol,                     
    Not for gross good alone which ye produce,
    But for the impertinent and ceaseless strife
    Of proofs and reasons ye preclude--in those
    Who to your dull society are born,
    And with their humble birthright rest content.               
    --Would I had ne'er renounced it!"
                                        A slight flush
    Of moral anger previously had tinged
    The old Man's cheek; but, at this closing turn
    Of self-reproach, it passed away. Said he,
    "That which we feel we utter; as we think                    
    So have we argued; reaping for our pains
    No visible recompense. For our relief
    You," to the Pastor turning thus he spake,
    "Have kindly interposed. May I entreat
    Your further help? The mine of real life                     
    Dig for us; and present us, in the shape
    Of virgin ore, that gold which we, by pains
    Fruitless as those of aëry alchemists,
    Seek from the torturing crucible. There lies
    Around us a domain where you have long                       
    Watched both the outward course and inner heart:
    Give us, for our abstractions, solid facts;
    For our disputes, plain pictures. Say what man
    He is who cultivates yon hanging field;
    What qualities of mind she bears, who comes,                 
    For morn and evening service, with her pail,
    To that green pasture; place before our sight
    The family who dwell within yon house
    Fenced round with glittering laurel; or in that
    Below, from which the curling smoke ascends.                 
    Or rather, as we stand on holy earth,
    And have the dead around us, take from them
    Your instances; for they are both best known,
    And by frail man most equitably judged.
    Epitomise the life; pronounce, you can,                      
    Authentic epitaphs on some of these
    Who, from their lowly mansions hither brought,
    Beneath this turf lie mouldering at our feet:
    So, by your records, may our doubts be solved;
    And so, not searching higher, we may learn                   
    _To prize the breath we share with human kind;
    And look upon the dust of man with awe._"

      The Priest replied--"An office you impose
    For which peculiar requisites are mine;
    Yet much, I feel, is wanting--else the task                  
    Would be most grateful. True indeed it is
    That they whom death has hidden from our sight
    Are worthiest of the mind's regard; with these
    The future cannot contradict the past:
    Mortality's last exercise and proof                         
    Is undergone; the transit made that shows
    The very Soul, revealed as she departs.
    Yet, on your first suggestion, will I give,
    Ere we descend into these silent vaults,
    One picture from the living.
                                  "You behold,                   
    High on the breast of yon dark mountain, dark
    With stony barrenness, a shining speck
    Bright as a sunbeam sleeping till a shower
    Brush it away, or cloud pass over it;                        
    And such it might be deemed--a sleeping sunbeam;
    But 'tis a plot of cultivated ground,
    Cut off, an island in the dusky waste;
    And that attractive brightness is its own.
    The lofty site, by nature framed to tempt
    Amid a wilderness of rocks and stones                        
    The tiller's hand, a hermit might have chosen,
    For opportunity presented, thence
    Far forth to send his wandering eye o'er land
    And ocean, and look down upon the works,
    The habitations, and the ways of men,                        
    Himself unseen! But no tradition tells
    That ever hermit dipped his maple dish
    In the sweet spring that lurks 'mid yon green fields;
    And no such visionary views belong
    To those who occupy and till the ground,                     
    High on that mountain where they long have dwelt
    A wedded pair in childless solitude.
    A house of stones collected on the spot,
    By rude hands built, with rocky knolls in front,
    Backed also by a ledge of rock, whose crest                  
    Of birch-trees waves over the chimney top;
    A rough abode--in colour, shape, and size,
    Such as in unsafe times of border-war
    Might have been wished for and contrived, to elude
    The eye of roving plunderer--for their need                  
    Suffices; and unshaken bears the assault
    Of their most dreaded foe, the strong South-west
    In anger blowing from the distant sea.
    --Alone within her solitary hut;
    There, or within the compass of her fields,                  
    At any moment may the Dame be found,
    True as the stock-dove to her shallow nest
    And to the grove that holds it. She beguiles
    By intermingled work of house and field
    The summer's day, and winter's; with success                 
    Not equal, but sufficient to maintain,
    Even at the worst, a smooth stream of content,
    Until the expected hour at which her Mate
    From the far-distant quarry's vault returns;
    And by his converse crowns a silent day                      
    With evening cheerfulness. In powers of mind,
    In scale of culture, few among my flock
    Hold lower rank than this sequestered pair:
    But true humility descends from heaven;
    And that best gift of heaven hath fallen on them;            
    Abundant recompense for every want.
    --Stoop from your height, ye proud, and copy these!
    Who, in their noiseless dwelling-place, can hear
    The voice of wisdom whispering scripture texts
    For the mind's government, or temper's peace;                
    And recommending for their mutual need,
    Forgiveness, patience, hope, and charity!"

      "Much was I pleased," the grey-haired Wanderer said,
    "When to those shining fields our notice first
    You turned; and yet more pleased have from your lips
    Gathered this fair report of them who dwell             
    In that retirement; whither, by such course
    Of evil hap and good as oft awaits
    A tired way-faring man, once _I_ was brought
    While traversing alone yon mountain pass.                    
    Dark on my road the autumnal evening fell,
    And night succeeded with unusual gloom,
    So hazardous that feet and hands became
    Guides better than mine eyes--until a light
    High in the gloom appeared, too high, methought,             
    For human habitation; but I longed
    To reach it, destitute of other hope.
    I looked with steadiness as sailors look
    On the north star, or watch-tower's distant lamp,
    And saw the light--now fixed--and shifting now--
    Not like a dancing meteor, but in line
    Of never-varying motion, to and fro.
    It is no night-fire of the naked hills,
    Thought I some friendly covert must be near.
    With this persuasion thitherward my steps                    
    I turn, and reach at last the guiding light;
    Joy to myself! but to the heart of her
    Who there was standing on the open hill,
    (The same kind Matron whom your tongue hath praised)
    Alarm and disappointment! The alarm                          
    Ceased, when she learned through what mishap I came,
    And by what help had gained those distant fields.
    Drawn from her cottage, on that aëry height,
    Bearing a lantern in her hand she stood,
    Or paced the ground--to guide her Husband home,              
    By that unwearied signal, kenned afar;
    An anxious duty! which the lofty site,
    Traversed but by a few irregular paths,
    Imposes, whensoe'er untoward chance
    Detains him after his accustomed hour                        
    Till night lies black upon the ground. 'But come,
    Come,' said the Matron, 'to our poor abode;
    Those dark rocks hide it!'  Entering, I beheld
    A blazing fire--beside a cleanly hearth
    Sate down; and to her office, with leave asked,              
    The Dame returned.
                        "Or ere that glowing pile
    Of mountain turf required the builder's hand
    Its wasted splendour to repair, the door
    Opened, and she re-entered with glad looks,
    Her Helpmate following. Hospitable fare,                     
    Frank conversation, made the evening's treat:
    Need a bewildered traveller wish for more?
    But more was given; I studied as we sate
    By the bright fire, the good Man's form, and face
    Not less than beautiful; an open brow                   
    Of undisturbed humanity; a cheek
    Suffused with something of a feminine hue; 
    Eyes beaming courtesy and mild regard;
    But, in the quicker turns of the discourse,
    Expression slowly varying, that evinced                      
    A tardy apprehension. From a fount
    Lost, thought I, in the obscurities of time,
    But honoured once, those features and that mien
    May have descended, though I see them here.
    In such a man, so gentle and subdued,                        
    Withal so graceful in his gentleness,
    A race illustrious for heroic deeds,
    Humbled, but not degraded, may expire.
    This pleasing fancy (cherished and upheld
    By sundry recollections of such fall                         
    From high to low, ascent from low to high,
    As books record, and even the careless mind
    Cannot but notice among men and things)
    Went with me to the place of my repose.

      "Roused by the crowing cock at dawn of day,                
    I yet had risen too late to interchange
    A morning salutation with my Host,
    Gone forth already to the far-off seat
    Of his day's work. 'Three dark mid-winter months
    'Pass,' said the Matron, 'and I never see,                   
    'Save when the sabbath brings its kind release,
    'My helpmate's face by light of day. He quits
    'His door in darkness, nor till dusk returns.
    'And, through Heaven's blessing, thus we gain the bread
    'For which we pray; and for the wants provide                
    'Of sickness, accident, and helpless age.
    'Companions have I many; many friends,
    'Dependants, comforters--my wheel, my fire,
    'All day the house-clock ticking in mine ear,
    'The cackling hen, the tender chicken brood,                 
    'And the wild birds that gather round my porch.
    'This honest sheep-dog's countenance I read;
    'With him can talk; nor blush to waste a word
    'On creatures less intelligent and shrewd.
    'And if the blustering wind that drives the clouds           
    'Care not for me, he lingers round my door,
    'And makes me pastime when our tempers suit;--
    'But, above all, my thoughts are my support,
    'My comfort:--would that they were oftener fixed
    'On what, for guidance in the way that leads                 
    'To heaven, I know, by my Redeemer taught.'
    The Matron ended nor could I forbear
    To exclaim--'O happy! yielding to the law
    Of these privations, richer in the main!--
    While thankless thousands are opprest and clogged            
    By ease and leisure; by the very wealth
    And pride of opportunity made poor;
    While tens of thousands falter in their path,
    And sink, through utter want of cheering light;
    For you the hours of labour do not flag;                     
    For you each evening hath its shining star,
    And every sabbath-day its golden sun.'"

      "Yes!" said the Solitary with a smile
    That seemed to break from an expanding heart,
    "The untutored bird may found, and so construct,             
    And with such soft materials line, her nest
    Fixed in the centre of a prickly brake,
    That the thorns wound her not; they only guard.
    Powers not unjustly likened to those gifts
    Of happy instinct which the woodland bird                    
    Shares with her species, nature's grace sometimes
    Upon the individual doth confer,
    Among her higher creatures born and trained
    To use of reason. And, I own that, tired
    Of the ostentatious world--a swelling stage                  
    With empty actions and vain passions stuffed,
    And from the private struggles of mankind
    Hoping far less than I could wish to hope,
    Far less than once I trusted and believed--
    I love to hear of those, who, not contending                 
    Nor summoned to contend for virtue's prize,
    Miss not the humbler good at which they aim,
    Blest with a kindly faculty to blunt
    The edge of adverse circumstance, and turn
    Into their contraries the petty plagues                      
    And hindrances with which they stand beset.
    In early youth, among my native hills,
    I knew a Scottish Peasant who possessed
    A few small crofts of stone-encumbered ground;
    Masses of every shape and size, that lay                     
    Scattered about under the mouldering walls
    Of a rough precipice; and some, apart,
    In quarters unobnoxious to such chance,
    As if the moon had showered them down in spite.
    But he repined not. Though the plough was scared             
    By these obstructions, 'round the shady stones
    A fertilising moisture,' said the Swain,
    'Gathers, and is preserved; and feeding dews
    'And damps, through all the droughty summer day
    'From out their substance issuing, maintain                  
    'Herbage that never fails: no grass springs up
    'So green, so fresh, so plentiful, as mine!'
    But thinly sown these natures; rare, at least,
    The mutual aptitude of seed and soil
    That yields such kindly product. He, whose bed               
    Perhaps yon loose sods cover, the poor Pensioner
    Brought yesterday from our sequestered dell
    Here to lie down in lasting quiet, he,
    If living now, could otherwise report
    Of rustic loneliness: that grey-haired Orphan--              
    So call him, for humanity to him
    No parent was--feelingly could have told,
    In life, in death, what solitude can breed
    Of selfishness, and cruelty, and vice;
    Or, if it breed not, hath not power to cure.                 
    --But your compliance, Sir! with our request
    My words too long have hindered."
                                      Undeterred,
    Perhaps incited rather, by these shocks,
    In no ungracious opposition, given
    To the confiding spirit of his own                           
    Experienced faith, the reverend Pastor said,
    Around him looking; "Where shall I begin?
    Who shall be first selected from my flock
    Gathered together in their peaceful fold?"
    He paused--and having lifted up his eyes                     
    To the pure heaven, he cast them down again
    Upon the earth beneath his feet; and spake:--

      "To a mysteriously-united pair
    This place is consecrate; to Death and Life,
    And to the best affections that proceed                      
    From their conjunction; consecrate to faith
    In him who bled for man upon the cross;
    Hallowed to revelation; and no less
    To reason's mandates; and the hopes divine
    Of pure imagination;--above all,                             
    To charity, and love, that have provided,
    Within these precincts, a capacious bed
    And receptacle, open to the good
    And evil, to the just and the unjust;
    In which they find an equal resting-place:                   
    Even as the multitude of kindred brooks
    And streams, whose murmur fills this hollow vale,
    Whether their course be turbulent or smooth,
    Their waters clear or sullied, all are lost
    Within the bosom of yon crystal Lake,                        
    And end their journey in the same repose!

      "And blest are they who sleep; and we that know,
    While in a spot like this we breathe and walk,
    That all beneath us by the wings are covered
    Of motherly humanity, outspread                              
    And gathering all within their tender shade,
    Though loth and slow to come! A battle-field,
    In stillness left when slaughter is no more,
    With this compared, makes a strange spectacle!
    A dismal prospect yields the wild shore strewn               
    With wrecks, and trod by feet of young and old
    Wandering about in miserable search
    Of friends or kindred, whom the angry sea
    Restores not to their prayer! Ah! who would think
    That all the scattered subjects which compose                
    Earth's melancholy vision through the space
    Of all her climes--these wretched, these depraved,
    To virtue lost, insensible of peace,
    From the delights of charity cut off,
    To pity dead, the oppressor and the opprest;                 
    Tyrants who utter the destroying word,
    And slaves who will consent to be destroyed--
    Were of one species with the sheltered few,
    Who, with a dutiful and tender hand,
    Lodged, in a dear appropriated spot,
    This file of infants; some that never breathed
    The vital air; others, which, though allowed
    That privilege, did yet expire too soon,
    Or with too brief a warning, to admit
    Administration of the holy rite                              
    That lovingly consigns the babe to the arms
    Of Jesus, and his everlasting care.
    These that in trembling hope are laid apart;
    And the besprinkled nursling, unrequired
    Till he begins to smile upon the breast                      
    That feeds him; and the tottering little-one
    Taken from air and sunshine when the rose
    Of infancy first blooms upon his cheek;
    The thinking, thoughtless, school-boy; the bold youth
    Of soul impetuous, and the bashful maid                      
    Smitten while all the promises of life
    Are opening round her; those of middle age,
    Cast down while confident in strength they stand,
    Like pillars fixed more firmly, as might seem,
    And more secure, by very weight of all                       
    That, for support, rests on them; the decayed
    And burthensome; and lastly, that poor few
    Whose light of reason is with age extinct;
    The hopeful and the hopeless, first and last,
    The earliest summoned and the longest spared--               
    Are here deposited, with tribute paid
    Various, but unto each some tribute paid;
    As if, amid these peaceful hills and groves,
    Society were touched with kind concern,
    And gentle 'Nature grieved, that one should die;'
    Or, if the change demanded no regret,                        
    Observed the liberating stroke--and blessed.

      "And whence that tribute? wherefore these regards?
    Not from the naked _Heart_ alone of Man
    (Though claiming high distinction upon earth            
    As the sole spring and fountain-head of tears,
    His own peculiar utterance for distress
    Or gladness)--No," the philosophic Priest
    Continued, "'tis not in the vital seat
    Of feeling to produce them, without aid                      
    From the pure soul, the soul sublime and pure;
    With her two faculties of eye and ear,
    The one by which a creature, whom his sins
    Have rendered prone, can upward look to heaven;
    The other that empowers him to perceive                      
    The voice of Deity, on height and plain,
    Whispering those truths in stillness, which the Word,
    To the four quarters of the winds, proclaims.
    Not without such assistance could the use
    Of these benign observances prevail:                         
    Thus are they born, thus fostered, thus maintained;
    And by the care prospective of our wise
    Forefathers, who, to guard against the shocks
    The fluctuation and decay of things,
    Embodied and established these high truths                  
    In solemn institutions:--men convinced
    That life is love and immortality,
    The being one, and one the element.
    There lies the channel, and original bed,
    From the beginning, hollowed out and scooped                
    For Man's affections--else betrayed and lost,
    And swallowed up 'mid deserts infinite!
    This is the genuine course, the aim, and end
    Of prescient reason; all conclusions else
    Are abject, vain, presumptuous, and perverse.               
    The faith partaking of those holy times,
    Life, I repeat, is energy of love
    Divine or human; exercised in pain,
    In strife, in tribulation; and ordained,
    If so approved and sanctified, to pass,                     
    Through shades and silent rest, to endless joy."
