Where lies the truth? has Man, in wisdom’s creed,
    A pitiable doom; for respite brief
    A care more anxious, or a heavier grief?
    Is he ungrateful, and doth little heed
    God’s bounty, soon forgotten; or indeed,                           
    Must Man, with labour born, awake to sorrow
    When Flowers rejoice and Larks with rival speed
    Spring from their nests to bid the Sun good morrow?
    They mount for rapture as their songs proclaim
    Warbled in hearing both of earth and sky;                         
    But o’er the contrast wherefore heave a sigh?
    Like those aspirants let us soar--our aim,
    Through life’s worst trials, whether shocks or snares,
    A happier, brighter, purer Heaven than theirs.
