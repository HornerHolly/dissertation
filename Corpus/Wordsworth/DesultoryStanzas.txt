 Is then the final page before me spread,
    Nor further outlet left to mind or heart?
    Presumptuous Book! too forward to be read,
    How can I give thee licence to depart?
    One tribute more: unbidden feelings start                      
    Forth from their coverts; slighted objects rise;
    My spirit is the scene of such wild art
    As on Parnassus rules, when lightning flies,
    Visibly leading on the thunder's harmonies.

    All that I saw returns upon my view,                          
    All that I heard comes back upon my ear,
    All that I felt this moment doth renew;
    And where the foot with no unmanly fear
    Recoiled--and wings alone could travel--there
    I move at ease; and meet contending themes                    
    That press upon me, crossing the career
    Of recollections vivid as the dreams
    Of midnight,--cities, plains, forests, and mighty streams.

    Where Mortal never breathed I dare to sit
    Among the interior Alps, gigantic crew,                       
    Who triumphed o'er diluvian power!--and yet
    What are they but a wreck and residue,
    Whose only business is to perish!--true
    To which sad course, these wrinkled Sons of Time
    Labour their proper greatness to subdue;                      
    Speaking of death alone, beneath a clime
    Where life and rapture flow in plenitude sublime.

    Fancy hath flung for me an airy bridge
    Across thy long deep Valley, furious Rhone!
    Arch that _here_ rests upon the granite ridge                 
    Of Monte Rosa--_there_ on frailer stone
    Of secondary birth, the Jung-frau's cone;
    And, from that arch, down-looking on the Vale
    The aspect I behold of every zone;
    A sea of foliage, tossing with the gale,                      
    Blithe Autumn's purple crown, and Winter's icy mail!

    Far as ST. MAURICE, from yon eastern FORKS,
    Down the main avenue my sight can range:
    And all its branchy vales, and all that lurks
    Within them, church, and town, and hut, and grange,           
    For my enjoyment meet in vision strange;
    Snows, torrents;--to the region's utmost bound,
    Life, Death, in amicable interchange;--
    But list! the avalanche--the hush profound
    That follows--yet more awful than that awful sound!

    Is not the chamois suited to his place?
    The eagle worthy of her ancestry?
    --Let Empires fall; but ne'er shall Ye disgrace
    Your noble birthright, ye that occupy
    Your council-seats beneath the open sky,
    On Sarnen's Mount,there judge of fit and right,
    In simple democratic majesty;
    Soft breezes fanning your rough brows--the might
    And purity of nature spread before your sight!

    From this appropriate Court, renowned LUCERNE                 
    Calls me to pace her honoured Bridge--that cheers
    The Patriot's heart with pictures rude and stern,
    An uncouth Chronicle of glorious years.
    Like portraiture, from loftier source, endears
    That work of kindred frame, which spans the lake              
    Just at the point of issue, where it fears
    The form and motion of a stream to take;
    Where it begins to stir, _yet_ voiceless as a snake.

    Volumes of sound, from the Cathedral rolled,
    This long-roofed Vista penetrate--but see,                   
    One after one, its tablets, that unfold
    The whole design of Scripture history;
    From the first tasting of the fatal Tree,
    Till the bright Star appeared in eastern skies,
    Announcing, ONE was born mankind to free;                     
    His acts, his wrongs, his final sacrifice;
    Lessons for every heart, a Bible for all eyes.

    _Our_ pride misleads, our timid likings kill.
    --Long may these homely Works devised of old,
    These simple efforts of Helvetian skill,                      
    Aid, with congenial influence, to uphold
    The State,--the Country's destiny to mould;
    Turning, for them who pass, the common dust
    Of servile opportunity to gold;
    Filling the soul with sentiments august--                     
    The beautiful, the brave, the holy, and the just!

    No more; Time halts not in his noiseless march--
    Nor turns, nor winds, as doth the liquid flood;
    Life slips from underneath us, like that arch
    Of airy workmanship whereon we stood,
    Earth stretched below, heaven in our neighbourhood.
    Go forth, my little Book! pursue thy way;
    Go forth, and please the gentle and the good;
    Nor be a whisper stifled, if it say
    That treasures, yet untouched, may grace some future Lay.
