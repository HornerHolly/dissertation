Part fenced by man, part by a rugged steep
    That curbs a foaming brook, a Grave-yard lies;
    The hare's best couching-place for fearless sleep;
    Which moonlit elves, far seen by credulous eyes,
    Enter in dance. Of church, or sabbath ties,                        
    No vestige now remains; yet thither creep
    Bereft Ones, and in lowly anguish weep
    Their prayers out to the wind and naked skies.
    Proud tomb is none; but rudely-sculptured knights,
    By humble choice of plain old times, are seen                     
    Level with earth, among the hillocks green:
    Union not sad, when sunny daybreak smites
    The spangled turf, and neighbouring thickets ring
    With _jubilate_ from the choirs of spring!
