Giordano, verily thy Pencil’s skill
    Hath here portrayed with Nature’s happiest grace
    The fair Endymion couched on Latmos-hill;
    And Dian gazing on the Shepherd’s face
    In rapture,--yet suspending her embrace,                           
    As not unconscious with what power the thrill
    Of her most timid touch his sleep would chase,
    And, with his sleep, that beauty calm and still.
    O may this work have found its last retreat
    Here in a Mountain-bard’s secure abode,                           
    One to whom, yet a School-boy, Cynthia showed
    A face of love which he in love would greet,
    Fixed, by her smile, upon some rocky seat;
    Or lured along where green-wood paths he trod.
