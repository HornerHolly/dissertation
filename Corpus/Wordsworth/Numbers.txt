What if our numbers barely could defy
    The arithmetic of babes, must foreign hordes,
    Slaves, vile as ever were befooled by words,
    Striking through English breasts the anarchy
    Of Terror, bear us to the ground, and tie                          
    Our hands behind our backs with felon cords?
    Yields every thing to discipline of swords?
    Is man as good as man, none low, none high?--
    Nor discipline nor valour can withstand
    The shock, nor quell the inevitable rout,                    
    When in some great extremity breaks out
    A people, on their own beloved Land
    Risen, like one man, to combat in the sight
    Of a just God for liberty and right.
