  Discourse was deemed Man’s noblest attribute,
    And written words the glory of his hand;
    Then followed Printing with enlarged command
    For thought--dominion vast and absolute
    For spreading truth, and making love expand.                       
    Now prose and verse sunk into disrepute
    Must lacquey a dumb Art that best can suit
    The taste of this once-intellectual Land.
    A backward movement surely have we here,
    From manhood--back to childhood; for the age--                    
    Back towards caverned life’s first rude career.
    Avaunt this vile abuse of pictured page!
    Must eyes be all in all, the tongue and ear
    Nothing? Heaven keep us from a lower stage!
