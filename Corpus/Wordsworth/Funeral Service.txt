 From the Baptismal hour, thro' weal and woe,
    The Church extends her care to thought and deed;
    Nor quits the Body when the Soul is freed,
    The mortal weight cast off to be laid low.
    Blest Rite for him who hears in faith, "I know                     
    That my Redeemer liveth,"--hears each word
    That follows--striking on some kindred chord
    Deep in the thankful heart;--yet tears will flow.
    Man is as grass that springeth up at morn,
    Grows green, and is cut down and withereth                        
    Ere nightfall--truth that well may claim a sigh,
    Its natural echo; but hope comes reborn
    At JESU'S bidding. We rejoice: "O Death
    Where is thy Sting?--O Grave where is thy Victory?"
