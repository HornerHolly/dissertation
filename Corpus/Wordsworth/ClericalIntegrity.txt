Nor shall the eternal roll of praise reject
    Those Unconforming; whom one rigorous day
    Drives from their Cures, a voluntary prey
    To poverty, and grief, and disrespect,
    And some to want--as if by tempests wrecked
    On a wild coast; how destitute! did They
    Feel not that Conscience never can betray,
    That peace of mind is Virtue's sure effect.
    Their altars they forego, their homes they quit,
    Fields which they love, and paths they daily trod,                
    And cast the future upon Providence;
    As men the dictate of whose inward sense
    Outweighs the world; whom self-deceiving wit
    Lures not from what they deem the cause of God.
