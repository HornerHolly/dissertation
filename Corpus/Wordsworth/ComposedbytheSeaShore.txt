 What mischief cleaves to unsubdued regret,
    How fancy sickens by vague hopes beset;
    How baffled projects on the spirit prey,
    And fruitless wishes eat the heart away,
    The Sailor knows; he best, whose lot is cast                       
    On the relentless sea that holds him fast
    On chance dependent, and the fickle star
    Of power, through long and melancholy war.
    O sad it is, in sight of foreign shores,
    Daily to think on old familiar doors,                             
    Hearths loved in childhood, and ancestral floors;
    Or, tossed about along a waste of foam,
    To ruminate on that delightful home,
    Which with the dear Betroth√®d _was_ to come;
    Or came and was and is, yet meets the eye                         
    Never but in the world of memory;
    Or in a dream recalled, whose smoothest range
    Is crossed by knowledge, or by dread, of change,
    And if not so, whose perfect joy makes sleep
    A thing too bright for breathing man to keep.                     
    Hail to the virtues which that perilous life
    Extracts from Nature's elemental strife;
    And welcome glory won in battles fought
    As bravely as the foe was keenly sought.
    But to each gallant Captain and his crew                          
    A less imperious sympathy is due,
    Such as my verse now yields, while moonbeams play
    On the mute sea in this unruffled bay;
    Such as will promptly flow from every breast,
    Where good men, disappointed in the quest                         
    Of wealth and power and honours, long for rest;
    Or, having known the splendours of success,
    Sigh for the obscurities of happiness.
