        The orderd troops
    In spiral circles mount aloft, and soar
    In prospect far above the denser air
    That hangs oer the moist plain. Again they view
    The glorious sun, and while the light of day
    Still gleams upon their polishd plumes the bright
    Sonorous squadrons sing their evening hymn.
