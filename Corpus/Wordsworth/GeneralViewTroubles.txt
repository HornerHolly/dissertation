 Aid, glorious Martyrs, from your fields of light,
    Our mortal ken! Inspire a perfect trust
    (While we look round) that Heaven's decrees are just:
    Which few can hold committed to a fight
    That shows, ev'n on its better side, the might                     
    Of proud Self-will, Rapacity, and Lust,
    'Mid clouds enveloped of polemic dust,
    Which showers of blood seem rather to incite
    Than to allay. Anathemas are hurled
    From both sides; veteran thunders (the brute test                
    Of truth) are met by fulminations new--
    Tartarean flags are caught at, and unfurled--
    Friends strike at friends--the flying shall pursue--
    And Victory sickens, ignorant where to rest!
