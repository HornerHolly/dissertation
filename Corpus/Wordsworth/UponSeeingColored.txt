    Who rashly strove thy Image to portray
    Thou buoyant minion of the tropic air;
    How could he think of the live creature gay
    With a divinity of colours, drest
    In all her brightness, from the dancing crest                      
    Far as the last gleam of the filmy train
    Extended and extending to sustain
    The motions that it graces and forbear
    To drop his pencil! Flowers of every clime
    Depicted on these pages smile at time;                            
    And gorgeous insects copied with nice care
    Are here, and likenesses of many a shell
    Tossed ashore by restless waves,
    Or in the diver grasp fetched up from caves
    Where sea-nymphs might be proud to dwell:                         
    But whose rash hand (again I ask) could dare,
    Mid casual tokens and promiscuous shows,
    To circumscribe this Shape in fixed repose;
    Could imitate for indolent survey,
    Perhaps for touch profane,                                        
    Plumes that might catch, but cannot keep, a stain;
    And, with cloud-streaks lightest and loftiest, share
    The sun first greeting, his last farewell ray!

      Resplendent Wanderer! followed with glad eyes
    Whereer her course; mysterious Bird!                             
    To whom, by wondering Fancy stirred,
    Eastern Islanders have given
    A holy name the Bird of Heaven
    And even a title higher still,
    The Bird of God! whose blessed will                           
    She seems performing as she flies
    Over the earth and through the skies
    In never-wearied search of Paradise
    Region that crowns her beauty with the name
    She bears for us for us how blest,                           
    How happy at all seasons, could like aim
    Uphold our Spirits urged to kindred flight
    On wings that fear no glance of God pure sight,
    No tempest from his breath, their promised rest
    Seeking with indefatigable quest                                  
    Above a world that deems itself most wise
    When most enslaved by gross realities!
