 Fallen, and diffused into a shapeless heap,
    Or quietly self-buried in earth's mould,
    Is that embattled House, whose massy Keep
    Flung from yon cliff a shadow large and cold.
    There dwelt the gay, the bountiful, the bold;                  
    Till nightly lamentations, like the sweep
    Of winds--though winds were silent--struck a deep
    And lasting terror through that ancient Hold.
    Its line of Warriors fled;--they shrunk when tried
    By ghostly power:--but Time's unsparing hand                  
    Hath plucked such foes, like weeds, from out the land;
    And now, if men with men in peace abide,
    All other strength the weakest may withstand,
    All worse assaults may safely be defied.
