  Did pangs of grief for lenient time too keen,
    Grief that devouring waves had caused--or guilt
    Which they had witnessed, sway the man who built
    This Homestead, placed where nothing could be seen,
    Nought heard, of ocean troubled or serene?                         
    A tired Ship-soldier on paternal land,
    That o'er the channel holds august command,
    The dwelling raised,--a veteran Marine!
    He, in disgust, turned from the neighbouring sea
    To shun the memory of a listless life                             
    That hung between two callings. May no strife
    More hurtful here beset him, doomed though free,
    Self-doomed, to worse inaction, till his eye
    Shrink from the daily sight of earth and sky!
