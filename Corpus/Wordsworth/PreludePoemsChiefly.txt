   In desultory walk through orchard grounds,
    Or some deep chestnut grove, oft have I paused
    The while a Thrush, urged rather than restrained
    By gusts of vernal storm, attuned his song
    To his own genial instincts; and was heard                         
    (Though not without some plaintive tones between)
    To utter, above showers of blossom swept
    From tossing boughs, the promise of a calm,
    Which the unsheltered traveller might receive
    With thankful spirit. The descant, and the wind                   
    That seemed to play with it in love or scorn,
    Encouraged and endeared the strain of words
    That haply flowed from me, by fits of silence
    Impelled to livelier pace. But now, my Book!
    Charged with those lays, and others of like mood,                 
    Or loftier pitch if higher rose the theme,
    Go, single--yet aspiring to be joined
    With thy Forerunners that through many a year
    Have faithfully prepared each other’s way--
    Go forth upon a mission best fulfilled                            
    When and wherever, in this changeful world,
    Power hath been given to please for higher ends
    Than pleasure only; gladdening to prepare
    For wholesome sadness, troubling to refine,
    Calming to raise; and, by a sapient Art                           
    Diffused through all the mysteries of our Being,
    Softening the toils and pains that have not ceased
    To cast their shadows on our mother Earth
    Since the primeval doom. Such is the grace
    Which, though unsued for, fails not to descend                    
    With heavenly inspiration; such the aim
    That Reason dictates; and, as even the wish
    Has virtue in it, why should hope to me
    Be wanting that sometimes, where fancied ills
    Harass the mind and strip from off the bowers                     
    Of private life their natural pleasantness,
    A Voice--devoted to the love whose seeds
    Are sown in every human breast, to beauty
    Lodged within compass of the humblest sight,
    To cheerful intercourse with wood and field,                      
    And sympathy with man’s substantial griefs--
    Will not be heard in vain? And in those days
    When unforeseen distress spreads far and wide
    Among a People mournfully cast down,
    Or into anger roused by venal words                               
    In recklessness flung out to overturn
    The judgment, and divert the general heart
    From mutual good--some strain of thine, my Book!
    Caught at propitious intervals, may win
    Listeners who not unwillingly admit                               
    Kindly emotion tending to console
    And reconcile; and both with young and old
    Exalt the sense of thoughtful gratitude
    For benefits that still survive, by faith
    In progress, under laws divine, maintained.
