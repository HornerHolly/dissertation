  By such examples moved to unbought pains,
    The people work like congregated bees;
    Eager to build the quiet Fortresses
    Where Piety, as they believe, obtains
    From Heaven a _general_ blessing; timely rains                     
    Or needful sunshine; prosperous enterprise,
    Justice and peace:--bold faith! yet also rise
    The sacred Structures for less doubtful gains.
    The Sensual think with reverence of the palms
    Which the chaste Votaries seek, beyond the grave;
    If penance be redeemable, thence alms                             
    Flow to the poor, and freedom to the slave;
    And if full oft the Sanctuary save
    Lives black with guilt, ferocity it calms.
