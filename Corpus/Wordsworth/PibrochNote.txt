 The pibroch's note, discountenanced or mute;
    The Roman kilt, degraded to a toy
    Of quaint apparel for a half-spoilt boy;
    The target mouldering like ungathered fruit;
    The smoking steam-boat eager in pursuit,                           
    As eagerly pursued; the umbrella spread
    To weather-fend the Celtic herdsman's head--
    All speak of manners withering to the root,
    And of old honours, too, and passions high:
    Then may we ask, though pleased that thought should range         
    Among the conquests of civility,
    Survives imagination--to the change
    Superior? Help to virtue does she give?
    If not, O Mortals, better cease to live!
