  "What know we of the Blest above
    But that they sing and that they love?"
    Yet, if they ever did inspire
    A mortal hymn, or shaped the choir,
    Now, where those harvest Damsels float                         
    Home-ward in their rugged Boat,
    (While all the ruffling winds are fled--
    Each slumbering on some mountain's head)
    Now, surely, hath that gracious aid
    Been felt, that influence is displayed.                      
    Pupils of Heaven, in order stand
    The rustic Maidens, every hand
    Upon a Sister's shoulder laid,--
    To chant, as glides the boat along,
    A simple, but a touching, song;                               
    To chant, as Angels do above,
    The melodies of Peace in love!
