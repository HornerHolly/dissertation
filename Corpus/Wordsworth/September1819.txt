  The sylvan slopes with corn-clad fields
    Are hung, as if with golden shields,
    Bright trophies of the sun!
    Like a fair sister of the sky,
    Unruffled doth the blue lake lie,                              
    The mountains looking on.

    And, sooth to say, yon vocal grove,
    Albeit uninspired by love,
    By love untaught to ring,
    May well afford to mortal ear                                 
    An impulse more profoundly dear
    Than music of the Spring.

    For _that_ from turbulence and heat
    Proceeds, from some uneasy seat
    In nature's struggling frame,                                 
    Some region of impatient life:
    And jealousy, and quivering strife,
    Therein a portion claim.

    This, this is holy;--while I hear
    These vespers of another year,                                
    This hymn of thanks and praise,
    My spirit seems to mount above
    The anxieties of human love,
    And earth's precarious days.

    But list!--though winter storms be nigh,                      
    Unchecked is that soft harmony;
    There lives Who can provide
    For all His creatures; and in Him,
    Even like the radiant Seraphim,
    These choristers confide.
