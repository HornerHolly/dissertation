   Ward of the LAW!--dread Shadow of a King!
    Whose realm had dwindled to one stately room;
    Whose universe was gloom immersed in gloom,
    Darkness as thick as life o'er life could fling,
    Save haply for some feeble glimmering
    Of Faith and Hope--if thou, by nature's doom,
    Gently hast sunk into the quiet tomb,
    Why should we bend in grief, to sorrow cling,
    When thankfulness were best?--Fresh-flowing tears,
    Or, where tears flow not, sigh succeeding sigh,               
    Yield to such after-thought the sole reply
    Which justly it can claim. The Nation hears
    In this deep knell, silent for threescore years,
    An unexampled voice of awful memory!
