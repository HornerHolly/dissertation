This Spot at once unfolding sight so fair
    Of sea and land, with yon grey towers that still
    Rise up as if to lord it over air
    Might soothe in human breasts the sense of ill,
    Or charm it out of memory; yea, might fill                         
    The heart with joy and gratitude to God
    For all his bounties upon man bestowed:
    Why bears it then the name of Weeping Hill
    Thousands, as toward yon old Lancastrian Towers,
    A prison crown, along this way they past                        
    For lingering durance or quick death with shame,
    From this bare eminence thereon have cast
    Their first look blinded as tears fell in showers
    Shed on their chains; and hence that doleful name.
