What is Hope? A smiling rainbow
     Children follow through the wet;
    'Tis not here, still yonder, yonder:
     Never urchin found it yet.

    What is Life? A thawing iceboard
     On a sea with sunny shore;--
    Gay we sail; it melts beneath us;
     We are sunk, and seen no more.

    What is Man? A foolish baby,
     Vainly strives, and fights, and frets;
    Demanding all, deserving nothing;--
     One small grave is what he gets

    Pause, Traveller! whosoe'er thou be
    Whom chance may lead to this retreat,
    Where silence yields reluctantly
    Even to the fleecy straggler's bleat;

    Give voice to what my hand shall trace,                        
    And fear not lest an idle sound
    Of words unsuited to the place
    Disturb its solitude profound.

    I saw this Rock, while vernal air
    Blew softly o'er the russet heath,                            
    Uphold a Monument as fair
    As church or abbey furnisheth.

    Unsullied did it meet the day,
    Like marble, white, like ether, pure;
    As if, beneath, some hero lay,                                
    Honoured with costliest sepulture.

    My fancy kindled as I gazed;
    And, ever as the sun shone forth,
    The flattered structure glistened, blazed,
    And seemed the proudest thing on earth.                       

    But frost had reared the gorgeous Pile
    Unsound as those which Fortune builds--
    To undermine with secret guile,
    Sapped by the very beam that gilds.

    And, while I gazed, with sudden shock                        
    Fell the whole Fabric to the ground;
    And naked left this dripping Rock,
    With shapeless ruin spread around!
