Yes, if the intensities of hope and fear
    Attract us still, and passionate exercise
    Of lofty thoughts, the way before us lies
    Distinct with signs, through which in set career,
    As through a zodiac, moves the ritual year          
    Of England's Church; stupendous mysteries!
    Which whoso travels in her bosom eyes,
    As he approaches them, with solemn cheer.
    Upon that circle traced from sacred story
    We only dare to cast a transient glance,                          
    Trusting in hope that Others may advance
    With mind intent upon the King of Glory,
    From his mild advent till his countenance
    Shall dissipate the seas and mountains hoary.
