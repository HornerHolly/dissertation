 Enough of garlands, of the Arcadian crook,
    And all that Greece and Italy have sung
    Of Swains reposing myrtle groves among!
    _Ours_ couch on naked rocks,--will cross a brook
    Swoln with chill rains, nor ever cast a look                       
    This way or that, or give it even a thought
    More than by smoothest pathway may be brought
    Into a vacant mind. Can written book
    Teach what _they_ learn? Up, hardy Mountaineer!
    And guide the Bard, ambitious to be One                           
    Of Nature's privy council, as thou art,
    On cloud-sequestered heights, that see and hear
    To what dread Powers He delegates his part
    On earth, who works in the heaven of heavens, alone.
