 Though to give timely warning and deter
    Is one great aim of penalty, extend
    Thy mental vision further and ascend
    Far higher, else full surely shalt thou err.
    What is a State? The wise behold in her                            
    A creature born of time, that keeps one eye
    Fixed on the statutes of Eternity,
    To which her judgments reverently defer.
    Speaking through Lawâ€™s dispassionate voice the State
    Endues her conscience with external life                          
    And being, to preclude or quell the strife
    Of individual will, to elevate
    The grovelling mind, the erring to recal,
    And fortify the moral sense of all.
