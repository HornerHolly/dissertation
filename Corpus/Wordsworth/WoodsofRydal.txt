Wild Redbreast! hadst them at Jemimas lip
    Pecked, as at mine, thus boldly, Love might say
    A halfblown rose had tempted thee to sip
    Its glistening dews: but hallowed is the clay
    Which the Muse warms; and I, whose head is grey,
    Am not unworthy of thy fellowship;
    Nor could I let one thought one motion slip
    That might thy sylvan confidence betray.
    For are we not all His without whose care
    Vouchsafed no sparrow falleth to the ground?
    Who gives his Angels wings to speed through air,
    And rolls the planets through the blue profound;
    Then peck or perch, fond Flutterer! nor forbear
    To trust a Poet in still musings bound.
