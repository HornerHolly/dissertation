Dear to the Loves, and to the Graces vowed,
    The Queen drew back the wimple that she wore;
    And to the throng, that on the Cumbrian shore
    Her landing hailed, how touchingly she bowed!
    And like a Star (that, from a heavy cloud                    
    Of pine-tree foliage poised in air, forth darts,
    When a soft summer gale at evening parts
    The gloom that did its loveliness enshroud)
    She smiled;but Time, the old Saturnian seer,
    Sighed on the wing as her foot pressed the strand,                
    With step prelusive to a long array
    Of woes and degradations hand in hand--
    Weeping captivity, and shuddering fear
    Stilled by the ensanguined block of Fotheringay!
