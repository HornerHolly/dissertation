 But whence came they who for the Saviour Lord
    Have long borne witness as the Scriptures teach?--
    Ages ere Valdo raised his voice to preach
    In Gallic ears the unadulterate Word,
    Their fugitive Progenitors explored                                
    Subalpine vales, in quest of safe retreats
    Where that pure Church survives, though summer heats
    Open a passage to the Romish sword,
    Far as it dares to follow. Herbs self-sown,
    And fruitage gathered from the chesnut wood,                      
    Nourish the sufferers then; and mists, that brood
    O'er chasms with new-fallen obstacles bestrown,
    Protect them; and the eternal snow that daunts
    Aliens, is God's good winter for their haunts.
