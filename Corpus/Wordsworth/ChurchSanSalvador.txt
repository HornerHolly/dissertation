Thou sacred Pile! whose turrets rise
    From yon steep mountain's loftiest stage,
    Guarded by lone San Salvador;
    Sink (if thou must) as heretofore,
    To sulphurous bolts a sacrifice,                               
    But ne'er to human rage!

    On Horeb's top, on Sinai, deigned
    To rest the universal Lord:
    Why leap the fountains from their cells
    Where everlasting Bounty dwells?--                            
    That, while the Creature is sustained,
    His God may be adored.

    Cliffs, fountains, rivers, seasons, times--
    Let all remind the soul of heaven;
    Our slack devotion needs them all;                            
    And Faith--so oft of sense the thrall,
    While she, by aid of Nature, climbs--
    May hope to be forgiven.

    Glory, and patriotic Love,
    And all the Pomps of this frail "spot                         
    Which men call Earth," have yearned to seek,
    Associate with the simply meek,
    Religion in the sainted grove,
    And in the hallowed grot.

    Thither, in time of adverse shocks,                          
    Of fainting hopes and backward wills,
    Did mighty Tell repair of old--
    A Hero cast in Nature's mould,
    Deliverer of the steadfast rocks
    And of the ancient hills!                                    

    _He_, too, of battle-martyrs chief!
    Who, to recal his daunted peers,
    For victory shaped an open space,
    By gathering with a wide embrace,
    Into his single breast, a sheaf                         
    Of fatal Austrian spears,
