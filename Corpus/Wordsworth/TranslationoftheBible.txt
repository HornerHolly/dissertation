But, to outweigh all harm, the sacred Book,
    In dusty sequestration wrapt too long,
    Assumes the accents of our native tongue;
    And he who guides the plough, or wields the crook,
    With understanding spirit now may look                             
    Upon her records, listen to her song,
    And sift her laws--much wondering that the wrong,
    Which Faith has suffered, Heaven could calmly brook
    Transcendent Boon! noblest that earthly King
    Ever bestowed to equalize and bless                               
    Under the weight of mortal wretchedness!
    But passions spread like plagues, and thousands wild
    With bigotry shall tread the Offering
    Beneath their feet, detested and defiled.
