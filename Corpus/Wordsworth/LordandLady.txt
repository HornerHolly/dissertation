My Lord and Lady Darlington,
    I would not speak in snarling-tone;
    Nor, to you, good Lady Vane,
    Would I give one moment’s pain;
    Nor Miss Taylor, Captain Stamp,                                    
    Would I your flights of _memory_ cramp.
    Yet, having spent a summer’s day
    On the green margin of Loch Tay,
    And doubled (prospect ever bettering)
    The mazy reaches of Loch Katerine,                                
    And more than once been free at Luss,
    Loch Lomond’s beauties to discuss,
    And wished, at least, to hear the blarney
    Of the sly boatmen of Killarney,
    And dipped my hand in dancing wave                                
    Of Eau de Zurich, Lac Genève,
    And bowed to many a major domo
    On stately terraces of Como,
    And seen the Simplon’s forehead hoary,
    Reclined on Lago Maggiore                                         
    At breathless eventide at rest
    On the broad water’s placid breast,
    I, not insensible, Heaven knows,
    To all the charms this Station shows,
    Must tell you, Captain, Lord, and Ladies--                        
    For honest worth one poet’s trade is--
    That your praise appears to me
    Folly’s own hyperbole.
