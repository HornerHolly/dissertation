 Among the dwellers in the silent fields
    The natural heart is touched, and public way
    And crowded streets resound with ballad strains,
    Inspired by ONE whose very name bespeaks
    Favour divine, exalting human love;                                
    Whom, since her birth on bleak Northumbria coast,
    Known unto few but prized as far as known,
    A single Act endears to high and low
    Through the whole land to Manhood, moved in spite
    Of the world freezing cares--to generous Youth--                
    To Infancy, that lisps her praise to Age
    Whose eye reflects it, glistening through a tear
    Of tremulous admiration. Such true fame
    Awaits her _now_; but, verily, good deeds
    Do no imperishable record find                                    
    Save in the rolls of heaven, where hers may live
    A theme for angels, when they celebrate
    The high-souled virtues which forgetful earth
    Has witnessd. Oh! that winds and waves could speak
    Of things which their united power called forth                   
    From the pure depths of her humanity!
    A Maiden gentle, yet, at duty call,
    Firm and unflinching, as the Lighthouse reared
    On the Island rock, her lonely dwelling-place;
    Or like the invincible Rock itself that braves,                   
    Age after age, the hostile elements,
    As when it guarded holy Cuthbert cell.

      All night the storm had raged, nor ceased, nor paused,
    When, as day broke, the Maid, through misty air,
    Espies far off a Wreck, amid the surf,                            
    Beating on one of those disastrous isles--
    Half of a Vessel, half--no more; the rest
    Had vanished, swallowed up with all that there
    Had for the common safety striven in vain,
    Or thither thronged for refuge. With quick glance            
    Daughter and Sire through optic-glass discern,
    Clinging about the remnant of this Ship,
    Creatures--how precious in the Maiden sight!
    For whom, belike, the old Man grieves still more
    Than for their fellow sufferers engulfed                          
    Where every parting agony is hushed,
    And hope and fear mix not in further strife.
    But courage, Father! let us out to sea--
    A few may yet be saved. The Daughters words,
    Her earnest tone, and look beaming with faith,                    
    Dispel the Father doubts: nor do they lack
    The noble-minded Mother helping hand
    To launch the boat; and with her blessing cheered,
    And inwardly sustained by silent prayer,
    Together they put forth, Father and Child!                        
    Each grasps an oar, and struggling on they go--
    Rivals in effort; and, alike intent
    Here to elude and there surmount, they watch
    The billows lengthening, mutually crossed
    And shattered, and re-gathering their might;                      
    As if the tumult, by the Almighty will
    Were, in the conscious sea, roused and prolonged,
    That woman fortitude so tried, so proved--
    May brighten more and more!
                                      True to the mark,
    They stem the current of that perilous gorge,                     
    Their arms still strengthening with the strengthening heart,
    Though danger, as the Wreck is neard, becomes
    More imminent. Not unseen do they approach;
    And rapture, with varieties of fear
    Incessantly conflicting, thrills the frames                       
    Of those who, in that dauntless energy,
    Foretaste deliverance; but the least perturbed
    Can scarcely trust his eyes, when he perceives
    That of the pair--tossed on the waves to bring
    Hope to the hopeless, to the dying, life--                        
    One is a Woman, a poor earthly sister,
    Or, be the Visitant other than she seems,
    A guardian Spirit sent from pitying Heaven,
    In woman shape. But why prolong the tale,
    Casting weak words amid a host of thoughts                        
    Armed to repel them? Every hazard faced
    And difficulty mastered, with resolve
    That no one breathing should be left to perish,
    This last remainder of the crew are all
    Placed in the little boat, then oer the deep                     
    Are safely borne, landed upon the beach,
    And, in fulfilment of God mercy, lodged
    Within the sheltering Lighthouse. Shout, ye Waves!
    Send forth a song of triumph. Waves and Winds,
    Exult in this deliverance wrought through faith                   
    In Him whose Providence your rage hath served!
    Ye screaming Sea-mews, in the concert join!
    And would that some immortal Voice a Voice
    Fitly attuned to all that gratitude
    Breathes out from floor or couch, through pallid lips             
    Of the survivors to the clouds might bear--
    Blended with praise of that parental love,
    Beneath whose watchful eye the Maiden grew
    Pious and pure, modest and yet so brave,
    Though young so wise, though meek so resolute--                   
    Might carry to the clouds and to the stars,
    Yea, to celestial Choirs, GRACE DARLING name!
