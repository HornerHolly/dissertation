   Peaceful our valley, fair and green;
      And beautiful the cottages
    Each in its nook, its sheltered hold,
      Or underneath its tuft of trees.

    Many and beautiful they are;                                       
      But there is one that I love best,
    A lowly roof in truth it is,
      A brother of the rest.

    Yet when I sit on rock or hill
      Downlooking on the valley fair,                                
    That cottage with its grove of trees
      Summons my heart; it settles there.

    Others there are whose small domain
      Of fertile fields with hedgerows green
    Might more seduce the traveller mind                            
      To wish that there his home had been.

    Such wish be his! I blame him not,
      My fancies they, perchance, are wild;
    I love that house because it is
      The very mountain child.                                      

    Fields hath it of its own, green fields;
      But they are craggy, steep, and bare;
    Their fence is of the mountain stone,
      And moss and lichen flourish there.

    And when the storm comes from the North                           
      It lingers near that pastoral spot,
    And piping through the mossy walls,
      It seems delighted with its lot.

    And let it take its own delight,
      And let it range the pastures bare                              
    Until it reach that grove of trees
      It may not enter there!

    A green unfading grove it is,
      Skirted with many a lesser tree,
    Hazel and holly, beech and oak,                                   
      A fair and flourishing company!

    Precious the shelter of those trees!
      They screen the cottage that I love;
    The sunshine pierces to the roof
      And the tall pine trees tower above.                            

    When first I saw that dear abode
      It was a lovely winters day:
    After a night of perilous storm
      The West wind ruled with gentle sway;

    A day so mild, it might have been                                 
      The first day of the gladsome spring;
    The robins warbled; and I heard
      One solitary throstle sing:

    A stranger in the neighbourhood,
      All faces then to me unknown,                                    
    I left my sole companion-friend
      To wander out alone.

    Lurd by a little winding path,
      I quitted soon the public road,
    A smooth and tempting path it was                                 
      By sheep and shepherds trod.

    Eastward, toward the mighty hills
      This pathway led me on,
    Until I reachd a lofty Rock
      With velvet moss oergrown.                                      

    With russet Oak and tufts of Fern
      Its top was richly garlanded;
    Its sides adornd with Eglantine
      Bedroppd with hips of glossy red.

    There too in many a shelterd chink                               
      The foxgloves broad leaves flourishâ€™d fair,
    And silver birch whose purple twigs
      Bend to the softest breathing air.

    Beneath that rock my course I stayd
      And, looking to its summit high,                                 
    Thou wearst, said I, a splendid garb,
      Here winter keeps his revelry.

    Ive been a dweller on the plains,
      Have sighd when summer days were gone;
    No more Ill sigh; for winter here                                
      Hath gladsome gardens of his own.

    What need of flowers? The splendid moss
      Is gayer than an April mead;
    More rich its hues of various green,
      Orange and gold and glowing red.                             

    Beside that gay and lovely rock
      There came with merry voice
    A foaming streamlet glancing by,
      It seemd to say Rejoice

    My youthful wishes all fulfilld,                                 
      Wishes matured by thoughtful choice,
    I stood an Inmate of this vale,
      How could I but rejoice
