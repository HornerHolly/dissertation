"Her divine skill taught me this,
  That from every thing I saw
  I could some instruction draw,
  And raise pleasure to the height
  Through the meanest object's sight.
  By the murmur of a spring,
  Or the least bough's rustelling;
  By a Daisy whose leaves spread
  Shut when Titan goes to bed;
  Or a shady bush or tree;
  She could more infuse in me
  Than all Nature's beauties can
  In some other wiser man."
