 Hail, Virgin Queen! o'er many an envious bar
    Triumphant, snatched from many a treacherous wile!
    All hail, sage Lady, whom a grateful Isle
    Hath blest, respiring from that dismal war
    Stilled by thy voice! But quickly from afar                        
    Defiance breathes with more malignant aim;
    And alien storms with home-bred ferments claim
    Portentous fellowship. Her silver car,
    By sleepless prudence ruled, glides slowly on;
    Unhurt by violence, from menaced taint                            
    Emerging pure, and seemingly more bright:
    Ah! wherefore yields it to a foul constraint
    Black as the clouds its beams dispersed, while shone,
    By men and angels blest, the glorious light?
