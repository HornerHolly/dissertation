 Thus is the storm abated by the craft
    Of a shrewd Counsellor, eager to protect
    The Church, whose power hath recently been checked,
    Whose monstrous riches threatened. So the shaft
    Of victory mounts high, and blood is quaffed                      
    In fields that rival Cressy and Poictiers
    Pride to be washed away by bitter tears!
    For deep as Hell itself, the avenging draught
    Of civil slaughter. Yet, while temporal power
    Is by these shocks exhausted, spiritual truth                     
    Maintains the else endangered gift of life;
    Proceeds from infancy to lusty youth;
    And, under cover of this woeful strife,
    Gathers unblighted strength from hour to hour.
