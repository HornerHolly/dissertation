 Happy the feeling from the bosom thrown
    In perfect shape (whose beauty Time shall spare
    Though a breath made it) like a bubble blown
    For summer pastime into wanton air;
    Happy the thought best likened to a stone                          
    Of the sea-beach, when, polished with nice care,
    Veins it discovers exquisite and rare,
    Which for the loss of that moist gleam atone
    That tempted first to gather it. That here,
    O chief of Friends! such feelings I present,                 
    To thy regard, with thoughts so fortunate,
    Were a vain notion; but the hope is dear,
    That thou, if not with partial joy elate,
    Wilt smile upon this gift with more than mild content!
