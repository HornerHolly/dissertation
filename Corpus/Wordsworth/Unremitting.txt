The unremitting voice of nightly streams
    That wastes so oft, we think, its tuneful powers,
    If neither soothing to the worm that gleams
    Through dewy grass, nor small birds hushed in bowers,
    Nor unto silent leaves and drowsy flowers,--                       
    That voice of unpretending harmony
    (For who what is shall measure by what seems
    To be, or not to be,
    Or tax high Heaven with prodigality?)
    Wants not a healing influence that can creep                     
    Into the human breast, and mix with sleep
    To regulate the motion of our dreams
    For kindly issues--as through every clime
    Was felt near murmuring brooks in earliest time;
    As at this day, the rudest swains who dwell                       
    Where torrents roar, or hear the tinkling knell
    Of water-breaks, with grateful heart could tell.
