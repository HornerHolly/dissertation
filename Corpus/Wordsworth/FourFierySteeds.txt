 Four fiery steeds impatient of the rein
    Whirled us oâ€™er sunless ground beneath a sky
    As void of sunshine, when, from that wide plain,
    Clear tops of far-off mountains we descry,
    Like a Sierra of cerulean Spain,                                   
    All light and lustre. Did no heart reply?
    Yes, there was One;--for One, asunder fly
    The thousand links of that ethereal chain;
    And green vales open out, with grove and field,
    And the fair front of many a happy Home;                          
    Such tempting spots as into vision come
    While Soldiers, weary of the arms they wield
    And sick at heart of strifeful Christendom,
    Gaze on the moon by parting clouds revealed.
