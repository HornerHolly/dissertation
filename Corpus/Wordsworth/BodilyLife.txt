Our bodily life, some plead, that life the shrine
    Of an immortal spirit, is a gift
    So sacred, so informed with light divine,
    That no tribunal, though most wise to sift
    Deed and intent, should turn the Being adrift                      
    Into that world where penitential tear
    May not avail, nor prayer have for God ear
    A voice--that world whose veil no hand can lift
    For earthly sight. Eternity and Time
    _They_ urge, have interwoven claims and rights                   
    Not to be jeopardised through foulest crime:
    The sentence rule by mercy heaven-born lights.
    Even so; but measuring not by finite sense
    Infinite Power, perfect Intelligence.
