 See what gay wild flowers deck this earth-built Cot,
    Whose smoke, forth-issuing whence and how it may,
    Shines in the greeting of the sun's first ray
    Like wreaths of vapour without stain or blot.
    The limpid mountain rill avoids it not;                            
    And why shouldst thou?--If rightly trained and bred,
    Humanity is humble, finds no spot
    Which her Heaven-guided feet refuse to tread.
    The walls are cracked, sunk is the flowery roof,
    Undressed the pathway leading to the door;                        
    But love, as Nature loves, the lonely Poor;
    Search, for their worth, some gentle heart wrong-proof,
    Meek, patient, kind, and, were its trials fewer,
    Belike less happy.--Stand no more aloof!
