Was the aim frustrated by force or guile,
    When giants scooped from out the rocky ground,
    Tier under tier, this semicirque profound?
    (Giants--the same who built in Erin's isle
    That Causeway with incomparable toil!)--                       
    O, had this vast theatric structure wound
    With finished sweep into a perfect round,
    No mightier work had gained the plausive smile
    Of all-beholding Phoebus! But, alas,
    Vain earth! false world! Foundations must be laid             
    In Heaven; for, 'mid the wreck of IS and WAS,
    Things incomplete and purposes betrayed
    Make sadder transits o'er thought's optic glass
    Than noblest objects utterly decayed.
