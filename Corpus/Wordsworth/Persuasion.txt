   "Man's life is like a Sparrow, mighty King!
    "That--while at banquet with your Chiefs you sit
    "Housed near a blazing fire--is seen to flit
    "Safe from the wintry tempest. Fluttering,
    "Here did it enter; there, on hasty wing,                          
    "Flies out, and passes on from cold to cold;
    "But whence it came we know not, nor behold
    "Whither it goes. Even such, that transient Thing,
    "The human Soul; not utterly unknown
    "While in the Body lodged, her warm abode;                        
    "But from what world She came, what woe or weal
    "On her departure waits, no tongue hath shown;
    "This mystery if the Stranger can reveal,
    "His be a welcome cordially bestowed!"
