 The Lovers took within this ancient grove
    Their last embrace; beside those crystal springs
    The Hermit saw the Angel spread his wings
    For instant flight; the Sage in yon alcove
    Sate musing; on that hill the Bard would rove,                     
    Not mute, where now the linnet only sings:
    Thus every where to truth Tradition clings,
    Or Fancy localises Powers we love.
    Were only History licensed to take note
    Of things gone by, her meagre monuments                           
    Would ill suffice for persons and events:
    There is an ampler page for man to quote,
    A readier book of manifold contents,
    Studied alike in palace and in cot.
