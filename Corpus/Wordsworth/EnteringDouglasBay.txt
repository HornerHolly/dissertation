  The feudal Keep, the bastions of Cohorn,
    Even when they rose to check or to repel
    Tides of aggressive war, oft served as well
    Greedy ambition, armed to treat with scorn
    Just limits; but yon Tower, whose smiles adorn                     
    This perilous bay, stands clear of all offence;
    Blest work it is of love and innocence,
    A Tower of refuge built for the else forlorn.
    Spare it, ye waves, and lift the mariner,
    Struggling for life, into its saving arms!                        
    Spare, too, the human helpers! Do they stir
    'Mid your fierce shock like men afraid to die?
    No; their dread service nerves the heart it warms,
    And they are led by noble HILLARY.
