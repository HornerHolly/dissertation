 If there be prophets on whose spirits rest
    Past things, revealed like future, they can tell
    What Powers, presiding o'er the sacred well
    Of Christian Faith, this savage Island blessed
    With its first bounty. Wandering through the west,
    Did holy Paul a while in Britain dwell,                        
    And call the Fountain forth by miracle,
    And with dread signs the nascent Stream invest?
    Or He, whose bonds dropped off, whose prison doors
    Flew open, by an Angel's voice unbarred?
    Or some of humbler name, to these wild shores
    Storm-driven; who, having seen the cup of woe
    Pass from their Master, sojourned here to guard
    The precious Current they had taught to flow?
