 Mourn, Shepherd, near thy old grey stone;
  Thou Angler, by the silent flood;
  And mourn when thou art all alone,                    
  Thou Woodman, in the distant wood!

  Thou one blind Sailor, rich in joy
  Though blind, thy tunes in sadness hum;
  And mourn, thou poor half-witted Boy!
  Born deaf, and living deaf and dumb.                  

  Thou drooping sick Man, bless the Guide
  Who checked or turned thy headstrong youth,
  As he before had sanctified
  Thy infancy with heavenly truth.

  Ye Striplings, light of heart and gay,                
  Bold settlers on some foreign shore,
  Give, when your thoughts are turned this way,
  A sigh to him whom we deplore.

  For us who here in funeral strain
  With one accord our voices raise,                     
  Let sorrow overcharged with pain
  Be lost in thankfulness and praise.

  And when our hearts shall feel a sting
  From ill we meet or good we miss,
  May touches of his memory bring                       
  Fond healing, like a mother's kiss.
