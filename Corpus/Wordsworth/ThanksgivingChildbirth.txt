 The Vested Priest before the Altar stands;
    Approach, come gladly, ye prepared, in sight
    Of God and chosen friends, your troth to plight
    With the symbolic ring, and willing hands
    Solemnly joined. Now sanctify the bands,                           
    O Father!--to the Espoused thy blessing give,
    That mutually assisted they may live
    Obedient, as here taught, to thy commands.
    So prays the Church, to consecrate a Vow
    "The which would endless matrimony make";
    Union that shadows forth and doth partake
    A mystery potent human love to endow
    With heavenly, each more prized for the other's sake;
    Weep not, meek Bride! uplift thy timid brow.
