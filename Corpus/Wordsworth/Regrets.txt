 Would that our scrupulous Sires had dared to leave
    Less scanty measure of those graceful rites
    And usages, whose due return invites
    A stir of mind too natural to deceive;
    Giving to Memory help when she would weave                    
    A crown for Hope!--I dread the boasted lights
    That all too often are but fiery blights,
    Killing the bud o'er which in vain we grieve.
    Go, seek, when Christmas snows discomfort bring,
    The counter Spirit found in some gay church                       
    Green with fresh holly, every pew a perch
    In which the linnet or the thrush might sing,
    Merry and loud and safe from prying search,
    Strains offered only to the genial Spring.
