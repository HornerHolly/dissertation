  Since risen from ocean, ocean to defy,
    Appeared the Crag of Ailsa, ne'er did morn
    With gleaming lights more gracefully adorn
    His sides, or wreathe with mist his forehead high:
    Now, faintly darkening with the sun's eclipse,
    Still is he seen, in lone sublimity,
    Towering above the sea and little ships;
    For dwarfs the tallest seem while sailing by,
    Each for her haven; with her freight of Care,
    Pleasure, or Grief, and Toil that seldom looks                    
    Into the secret of to-morrow's fare;
    Though poor, yet rich, without the wealth of books,
    Or aught that watchful Love to Nature owes
    For her mute Powers, fix'd Forms, or transient Shows.
