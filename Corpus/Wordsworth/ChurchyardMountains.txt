  Hail to the crown by Freedom shaped--to gird
    An English Sovereign's brow! and to the throne
    Whereon he sits! Whose deep foundations lie
    In veneration and the people's love;
    Whose steps are equity, whose seat is law.                     
    --Hail to the State of England! And conjoin
    With this a salutation as devout,
    Made to the spiritual fabric of her Church;
    Founded in truth; by blood of Martyrdom
    Cemented; by the hands of Wisdom reared                       
    In beauty of holiness, with ordered pomp,
    Decent and unreproved. The voice, that greets
    The majesty of both, shall pray for both;
    That, mutually protected and sustained,[
    They may endure long as the sea surrounds                
    This favoured Land, or sunshine warms her soil.

      And O, ye swelling hills, and spacious plains!
    Besprent from shore to shore with steeple-towers,
    And spires whose 'silent finger points to heaven;'
    Nor wanting, at wide intervals, the bulk                      
    Of ancient minster lifted above the cloud
    Of the dense air, which town or city breeds
    To intercept the sun's glad beams--may ne'er
    That true succession fail of English hearts,
    Who, with ancestral feeling, can perceive
    What in those holy structures ye possess
    Of ornamental interest, and the charm
    Of pious sentiment diffused afar,
    And human charity, and social love.
    --Thus never shall the indignities of time                    
    Approach their reverend graces, unopposed;
    Nor shall the elements be free to hurt
    Their fair proportions; nor the blinder rage
    Of bigot zeal madly to overturn;
    And, if the desolating hand of war                            
    Spare them, they shall continue to bestow,
    Upon the thronged abodes of busy men
    (Depraved, and ever prone to fill the mind
    Exclusively with transitory things)
    An air and mien of dignified pursuit;                         
    Of sweet civility, on rustic wilds.

      The Poet, fostering for his native land
    Such hope, entreats that servants may abound
    Of those pure altars worthy; ministers
    Detached from pleasure, to the love of gain                   
    Superior, insusceptible of pride,
    And by ambitious longings undisturbed;
    Men, whose delight is where their duty leads
    Or fixes them; whose least distinguished day
    Shines with some portion of that heavenly lustre              
    Which makes the sabbath lovely in the sight
    Of blessed angels, pitying human cares.
    --And, as on earth it is the doom of truth
    To be perpetually attacked by foes
    Open or covert, be that priesthood still,                     
    For her defence, replenished with a band
    Of strenuous champions, in scholastic arts
    Thoroughly disciplined; nor (if in course
    Of the revolving world's disturbances
    Cause should recur, which righteous Heaven avert!
    To meet such trial) from their spiritual sires                
    Degenerate; who, constrained to wield the sword
    Of disputation, shrunk not, though assailed
    With hostile din, and combating in sight
    Of angry umpires, partial and unjust;                         
    And did, thereafter, bathe their hands in fire,
    So to declare the conscience satisfied:
    Nor for their bodies would accept release;
    But, blessing God and praising him, bequeathed                
    With their last breath, from out the smouldering flame,
    The faith which they by diligence had earned,
    Or, through illuminating grace, received,
    For their dear countrymen, and all mankind.
    O high example, constancy divine!

      Even such a Man (inheriting the zeal                        
    And from the sanctity of elder times
    Not deviating,--a priest, the like of whom,
    If multiplied, and in their stations set,
    Would o'er the bosom of a joyful land
    Spread true religion and her genuine fruits)                  
    Before me stood that day; on holy ground
    Fraught with the relics of mortality,
    Exalting tender themes, by just degrees
    To lofty raised; and to the highest, last;
    The head and mighty paramount of truths,--                    
    Immortal life, in never-fading worlds,
    For mortal creatures, conquered and secured.

      That basis laid, those principles of faith
    Announced, as a preparatory act
    Of reverence done to the spirit of the place,
    The Pastor cast his eyes upon the ground;
    Not, as before, like one oppressed with awe,
    But with a mild and social cheerfulness;
    Then to the Solitary turned, and spake.

      "At morn or eve, in your retired domain,                    
    Perchance you not unfrequently have marked
    A Visitor--in quest of herbs and flowers;
    Too delicate employ, as would appear,
    For one, who, though of drooping mien, had yet
    From nature's kindliness received a frame                    
    Robust as ever rural labour bred."

      The Solitary answered: "Such a Form
    Full well I recollect. We often crossed
    Each other's path; but, as the Intruder seemed
    Fondly to prize the silence which he kept,                   
    And I as willingly did cherish mine,
    We met, and passed, like shadows. I have heard,
    From my good Host, that being crazed in brain
    By unrequited love, he scaled the rocks,
    Dived into caves, and pierced the matted woods,              
    In hope to find some virtuous herb of power
    To cure his malady!"
                          The Vicar smiled,--
    "Alas! before to-morrow's sun goes down
    His habitation will be here: for him
    That open grave is destined."
                                      "Died he then
    Of pain and grief?" the Solitary asked,                      
    "Do not believe it; never could that be!"

      "He loved," the Vicar answered, "deeply loved,
    Loved fondly, truly, fervently; and dared
    At length to tell his love, but sued in vain;
    Rejected, yea repelled; and, if with scorn
    Upon the haughty maiden's brow, 'tis but
    A high-prized plume which female Beauty wears
    In wantonness of conquest, or puts on
    To cheat the world, or from herself to hide                  
    Humiliation, when no longer free,
    _That_ he could brook, and glory in;--but when
    The tidings came that she whom he had wooed
    Was wedded to another, and his heart
    Was forced to rend away its only hope;                       
    Then, Pity could have scarcely found on earth
    An object worthier of regard than he,
    In the transition of that bitter hour!
    Lost was she, lost; nor could the Sufferer say
    That in the act of preference he had been                    
    Unjustly dealt with; but the Maid was gone!
    Had vanished from his prospects and desires;
    Not by translation to the heavenly choir
    Who have put off their mortal spoils--ah no!
    She lives another's wishes to complete,--                    
    'Joy be their lot, and happiness,' he cried,
    'His lot and hers, as misery must be mine!'

    "Such was that strong concussion; but the Man,
    Who trembled, trunk and limbs, like some huge oak
    By a fierce tempest shaken, soon resumed                     
    The stedfast quiet natural to a mind
    Of composition gentle and sedate,
    And, in its movements, circumspect and slow.
    To books, and to the long-forsaken desk,
    O'er which enchained by science he had loved                 
    To bend, he stoutly re-addressed himself,
    Resolved to quell his pain, and search for truth
    With keener appetite (if that might be)
    And closer industry. Of what ensued
    Within the heart no outward sign appeared               
    Till a betraying sickliness was seen
    To tinge his cheek; and through his frame it crept
    With slow mutation unconcealable;
    Such universal change as autumn makes
    In the fair body of a leafy grove                            
    Discoloured, then divested.
                                "'Tis affirmed
    By poets skilled in nature's secret ways
    That Love will not submit to be controlled
    By mastery:--and the good Man lacked not friends
    Who strove to instil this truth into his mind,               
    A mind in all heart-mysteries unversed.
    'Go to the hills,' said one, 'remit a while
    'This baneful diligence:--at early morn
    'Court the fresh air, explore the heaths and woods;
    'And, leaving it to others to foretell,                      
    'By calculations sage, the ebb and flow
    'Of tides, and when the moon will be eclipsed,
    'Do you, for your own benefit, construct
    'A calendar of flowers, plucked as they blow
    'Where health abides, and cheerfulness, and peace.'          
    The attempt was made;--'tis needless to report
    How hopelessly; but innocence is strong,
    And an entire simplicity of mind
    A thing most sacred in the eye of Heaven;
    That opens, for such sufferers, relief                       
    Within the soul, fountains of grace divine;
    And doth commend their weakness and disease
    To Nature's care, assisted in her office
    By all the elements that round her wait
    To generate, to preserve, and to restore;                    
    And by her beautiful array of forms
    Shedding sweet influence from above; or pure
    Delight exhaling from the ground they tread."

      "Impute it not to impatience, if," exclaimed
    The Wanderer, "I infer that he was healed                    
    By perseverance in the course prescribed."

      "You do not err: the powers, that had been lost
    By slow degrees, were gradually regained;
    The fluttering nerves composed; the beating heart
    In rest established; and the jarring thoughts                
    To harmony restored.--But yon dark mould
    Will cover him, in the fulness of his strength,
    Hastily smitten by a fever's force;
    Yet not with stroke so sudden as refused
    Time to look back with tenderness on her                     
    Whom he had loved in passion; and to send
    Some farewell words--with one, but one, request;
    That, from his dying hand, she would accept
    Of his possessions that which most he prized;
    A book, upon whose leaves some chosen plants,                
    By his own hand disposed with nicest care,
    In undecaying beauty were preserved;
    Mute register, to him, of time and place,
    And various fluctuations in the breast;
    To her, a monument of faithful love                          
    Conquered, and in tranquillity retained!

      "Close to his destined habitation, lies
    One who achieved a humbler victory,
    Though marvellous in its kind. A place there is
    High in these mountains, that allured a band                 
    Of keen adventurers to unite their pains
    In search of precious ore: they tried, were foiled--
    And all desisted, all, save him alone.
    He, taking counsel of his own clear thoughts,
    And trusting only to his own weak hands,                     
    Urged unremittingly the stubborn work,
    Unseconded, uncountenanced; then, as time
    Passed on, while still his lonely efforts found
    No recompense, derided; and at length,
    By many pitied, as insane of mind;                           
    By others dreaded as the luckless thrall
    Of subterranean Spirits feeding hope
    By various mockery of sight and sound;
    Hope after hope, encouraged and destroyed.
    --But when the lord of seasons had matured                   
    The fruits of earth through space of twice ten years,
    The mountain's entrails offered to his view
    And trembling grasp the long-deferred reward.
    Not with more transport did Columbus greet
    A world, his rich discovery! But our Swain,              
    A very hero till his point was gained,
    Proved all unable to support the weight
    Of prosperous fortune. On the fields he looked
    With an unsettled liberty of thought,
    Wishes and endless schemes; by daylight walked
    Giddy and restless; ever and anon                            
    Quaffed in his gratitude immoderate cups;
    And truly might be said to die of joy!
    He vanished; but conspicuous to this day
    The path remains that linked his cottage-door                
    To the mine's mouth; a long and slanting track,
    Upon the rugged mountain's stony side,
    Worn by his daily visits to and from
    The darksome centre of a constant hope.
    This vestige, neither force of beating rain,                 
    Nor the vicissitudes of frost and thaw
    Shall cause to fade, till ages pass away;
    And it is named, in memory of the event,
    The PATH OF PERSEVERANCE."
                                   "Thou from whom
    Man has his strength," exclaimed the Wanderer, "oh!
    Do thou direct it! To the virtuous grant                     
    The penetrative eye which can perceive
    In this blind world the guiding vein of hope;
    That, like this Labourer, such may dig their way,
    'Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified;'
    Grant to the wise _his_ firmness of resolve!"

      "That prayer were not superfluous," said the Priest,
    "Amid the noblest relics, proudest dust,
    That Westminster, for Britain's glory, holds
    Within the bosom of her awful pile,                          
    Ambitiously collected. Yet the sigh,
    Which wafts that prayer to heaven, is due to all,
    Wherever laid, who living fell below
    Their virtue's humbler mark; a sigh of _pain_
    If to the opposite extreme they sank.                        
    How would you pity her who yonder rests;
    Him, farther off; the pair, who here are laid;
    But, above all, that mixture of earth's mould
    Whom sight of this green hillock to my mind
    Recals!
             "_He_ lived not till his locks were nipped          
    By seasonable frost of age; nor died
    Before his temples, prematurely forced
    To mix the manly brown with silver grey,
    Gave obvious instance of the sad effect
    Produced, when thoughtless Folly hath usurped                
    The natural crown that sage Experience wears.
    Gay, volatile, ingenious, quick to learn,
    And prompt to exhibit all that he possessed
    Or could perform; a zealous actor, hired
    Into the troop of mirth, a soldier, sworn                    
    Into the lists of giddy enterprise--
    Such was he; yet, as if within his frame
    Two several souls alternately had lodged,
    Two sets of manners could the Youth put on;
    And, fraught with antics as the Indian bird                  
    That writhes and chatters in her wiry cage,
    Was graceful, when it pleased him, smooth and still
    As the mute swan that floats adown the stream,
    Or, on the waters of the unruffled lake,
    Anchors her placid beauty. Not a leaf,                      
    That flutters on the bough, lighter than he;
    And not a flower, that droops in the green shade,
    More winningly reserved! If ye enquire
    How such consummate elegance was bred
    Amid these wilds, this answer may suffice;                   
    'Twas Nature's will; who sometimes undertakes,
    For the reproof of human vanity,
    Art to outstrip in her peculiar walk.
    Hence, for this Favourite--lavishly endowed
    With personal gifts, and bright instinctive wit,             
    While both, embellishing each other, stood
    Yet farther recommended by the charm
    Of fine demeanour, and by dance and song,
    And skill in letters--every fancy shaped
    Fair expectations; nor, when to the world's                  
    Capacious field forth went the Adventurer, there
    Were he and his attainments overlooked,
    Or scantily rewarded; but all hopes,
    Cherished for him, he suffered to depart,
    Like blighted buds; or clouds that mimicked land             
    Before the sailor's eye; or diamond drops
    That sparkling decked the morning grass; or aught
    That _was_ attractive, and hath ceased to be!

      "Yet, when this Prodigal returned, the rites
    Of joyful greeting were on him bestowed,                     
    Who, by humiliation undeterred,
    Sought for his weariness a place of rest
    Within his Father's gates.--Whence came he?--clothed
    In tattered garb, from hovels where abides
    Necessity, the stationary host                               
    Of vagrant poverty; from rifted barns
    Where no one dwells but the wide-staring owl
    And the owl's prey; from these bare haunts, to which
    He had descended from the proud saloon,
    He came, the ghost of beauty and of health,                  
    The wreck of gaiety! But soon revived
    In strength, in power refitted, he renewed
    His suit to Fortune; and she smiled again
    Upon a fickle Ingrate. Thrice he rose,
    Thrice sank as willingly. For he--whose nerves          
    Were used to thrill with pleasure, while his voice
    Softly accompanied the tuneful harp,
    By the nice finger of fair ladies touched
    In glittering halls--was able to derive
    No less enjoyment from an abject choice.                
    Who happier for the moment--who more blithe
    Than this fallen Spirit? in those dreary holds
    His talents lending to exalt the freaks
    Of merry-making beggars,--now, provoked
    To laughter multiplied in louder peals                       
    By his malicious wit; then, all enchained
    With mute astonishment, themselves to see
    In their own arts outdone, their fame eclipsed,
    As by the very presence of the Fiend
    Who dictates and inspires illusive feats,                    
    For knavish purposes! The city, too,
    (With shame I speak it) to her guilty bowers
    Allured him, sunk so low in self-respect
    As there to linger, there to eat his bread,
    Hired minstrel of voluptuous blandishment;                   
    Charming the air with skill of hand or voice,
    Listen who would, be wrought upon who might,
    Sincerely wretched hearts, or falsely gay.
    --Such the too frequent tenour of his boast
    In ears that relished the report;--but all                  
    Was from his Parents happily concealed;
    Who saw enough for blame and pitying love.
    They also were permitted to receive
    His last, repentant breath; and closed his eyes,
    No more to open on that irksome world                        
    Where he had long existed in the state
    Of a young fowl beneath one mother hatched,
    Though from another sprung, different in kind:
    Where he had lived, and could not cease to live,
    Distracted in propensity; content                            
    With neither element of good or ill;
    And yet in both rejoicing; man unblest;
    Of contradictions infinite the slave,
    Till his deliverance, when Mercy made him
    One with himself, and one with them that sleep."

      "'Tis strange," observed the Solitary, "strange
    It seems, and scarcely less than pitiful,
    That in a land where charity provides
    For all that can no longer feed themselves,
    A man like this should choose to bring his shame             
    To the parental door; and with his sighs
    Infect the air which he had freely breathed
    In happy infancy. He could not pine,
    Through lack of converse; no--he must have found
    Abundant exercise for thought and speech,                    
    In his dividual being, self-reviewed,
    Self-catechised, self-punished.--Some there are
    Who, drawing near their final home, and much
    And daily longing that the same were reached,
    Would rather shun than seek the fellowship                   
    Of kindred mould.--Such haply here are laid?"

      "Yes," said the Priest, "the Genius of our hills--
    Who seems, by these stupendous barriers cast
    Round his domain, desirous not alone
    To keep his own, but also to exclude                         
    All other progeny--doth sometimes lure,
    Even by his studied depth of privacy,
    The unhappy alien hoping to obtain
    Concealment, or seduced by wish to find,
    In place from outward molestation free,                      
    Helps to internal ease. Of many such
    Could I discourse; but as their stay was brief,
    So their departure only left behind
    Fancies, and loose conjectures. Other trace
    Survives, for worthy mention, of a pair                      
    Who, from the pressure of their several fates,
    Meeting as strangers, in a petty town
    Whose blue roofs ornament a distant reach
    Of this far-winding vale, remained as friends            
    True to their choice; and gave their bones in trust
    To this loved cemetery, here to lodge
    With unescutcheoned privacy interred
    Far from the family vault.--A Chieftain one
    By right of birth; within whose spotless breast
    The fire of ancient Caledonia burned:                        
    He, with the foremost whose impatience hailed
    The Stuart, landing to resume, by force
    Of arms, the crown which bigotry had lost,
    Aroused his clan; and, fighting at their head,
    With his brave sword endeavoured to prevent                  
    Culloden's fatal overthrow. Escaped
    From that disastrous rout, to foreign shores
    He fled; and when the lenient hand of time
    Those troubles had appeased, he sought and gained,
    For his obscured condition, an obscure                       
    Retreat, within this nook of English ground.

      "The other, born in Britain's southern tract,
    Had fixed his milder loyalty, and placed
    His gentler sentiments of love and hate,
    There, where _they_ placed them who in conscience prized
    The new succession, as a line of kings                       
    Whose oath had virtue to protect the land
    Against the dire assaults of papacy
    And arbitrary rule. But launch thy bark
    On the distempered flood of public life,                     
    And cause for most rare triumph will be thine
    If, spite of keenest eye and steadiest hand,
    The stream, that bears thee forward, prove not, soon
    Or late, a perilous master. He--who oft,
    Beneath[548] the battlements and stately trees               
    That round his mansion cast a sober gloom,
    Had moralised on this, and other truths
    Of kindred import, pleased and satisfied--
    Was forced to vent his wisdom with a sigh
    Heaved from the heart in fortune's bitterness,               
    When he had crushed a plentiful estate
    By ruinous contest, to obtain a seat
    In Britain's senate. Fruitless was the attempt:
    And while the uproar of that desperate strife
    Continued yet to vibrate on his ear,                         
    The vanquished Whig, under a borrowed name,
    (For the mere sound and echo of his own
    Haunted him with sensations of disgust
    That he was glad to lose) slunk from the world
    To the deep shade of those untravelled Wilds;           
    In which the Scottish Laird had long possessed
    An undisturbed abode. Here, then, they met,
    Two doughty champions; flaming Jacobite
    And sullen Hanoverian! You might think
    That losses and vexations, less severe                       
    Than those which they had severally sustained,
    Would have inclined each to abate his zeal
    For his ungrateful cause; no,--I have heard
    My reverend Father tell that, 'mid the calm
    Of that small town encountering thus, they filled,           
    Daily, its bowling-green with harmless strife;
    Plagued with uncharitable thoughts the church;
    And vexed the market-place. But in the breasts
    Of these opponents gradually was wrought,
    With little change of general sentiment,                     
    Such leaning towards each other, that their days
    By choice were spent in constant fellowship;
    And if, at times, they fretted with the yoke,
    Those very bickerings made them love it more.                

      "A favourite boundary to their lengthened walks
    This Church-yard was. And, whether they had come
    Treading their path in sympathy and linked
    In social converse, or by some short space
    Discreetly parted to preserve the peace,
    One spirit seldom failed to extend its sway                  
    Over both minds, when they awhile had marked
    The visible quiet of this holy ground,
    And breathed its soothing air;--the spirit of hope
    And saintly magnanimity; that--spurning
    The field of selfish difference and dispute,                 
    And every care which transitory things,
    Earth and the kingdoms of the earth, create--
    Doth, by a rapture of forgetfulness,
    Preclude forgiveness, from the praise debarred,
    Which else the Christian virtue might have claimed.          

      "There live who yet remember here to have seen
    Their courtly figures, seated on the stump
    Of an old yew, their favourite resting-place.
    But as the remnant of the long-lived tree
    Was disappearing by a swift decay,                           
    They, with joint care, determined to erect,
    Upon its site, a dial, that might stand
    For public use preserved, and thus survive
    As their own private monument: for this
    Was the particular spot, in which they wished                
    (And Heaven was pleased to accomplish the desire)
    That, undivided, their remains should lie.
    So, where the mouldered tree had stood, was raised
    Yon structure, framing, with the ascent of steps
    That to the decorated pillar lead,                       
    A work of art more sumptuous than might seem
    To suit this place; yet built in no proud scorn
    Of rustic homeliness; they only aimed
    To ensure for it respectful guardianship.
    Around the margin of the plate, whereon                      
    The shadow falls to note the stealthy hours,
    Winds an inscriptive legend."--At these words
    Thither we turned; and gathered, as we read,
    The appropriate sense, in Latin numbers couched:
    '_Time flies; it is his melancholy task                      
    To bring, and bear away, delusive hopes,
    And re-produce the troubles he destroys.
    But, while his blindness thus is occupied,
    Discerning Mortal! do thou serve the will
    Of Time's eternal Master, and that peace,                    
    Which the world wants, shall be for thee confirmed!

      "Smooth verse, inspired by no unlettered Muse,"
    Exclaimed the Sceptic, "and the strain of thought
    Accords with nature's language;--the soft voice
    Of yon white torrent falling down the rocks
    Speaks, less distinctly, to the same effect.
    If, then, their blended influence be not lost
    Upon our hearts, not wholly lost, I grant,
    Even upon mine, the more are we required
    To feel for those among our fellow-men,                      
    Who, offering no obeisance to the world,
    Are yet made desperate by 'too quick a sense
    Of constant infelicity,' cut off
    From peace like exiles on some barren rock,
    Their life's appointed prison; not more free                 
    Than sentinels, between two armies, set,
    With nothing better, in the chill night air,
    Than their own thoughts to comfort them. Say why
    That ancient story of Prometheus chained
    To the bare rock, on frozen Caucasus;                      
    The vulture, the inexhaustible repast
    Drawn from his vitals? Say what meant the woes
    By Tantalus entailed upon his race,
    And the dark sorrows of the line of Thebes?
    Fictions in form, but in their substance truths,             
    Tremendous truths! familiar to the men
    Of long-past times, nor obsolete in ours.
    Exchange the shepherd's frock of native grey
    For robes with regal purple tinged; convert
    The crook into a sceptre; give the pomp                  
    Of circumstance; and here the tragic Muse
    Shall find apt subjects for her highest art.
    Amid the groves, under the shadowy hills,
    The generations are prepared; the pangs,
    The internal pangs, are ready; the dread strife              
    Of poor humanity's afflicted will
    Struggling in vain with ruthless destiny."

      "Though," said the Priest in answer, "these be terms
    Which a divine philosophy rejects,
    We, whose established and unfailing trust                    
    Is in controlling Providence, admit
    That, through all stations, human life abounds
    With mysteries;--for, if Faith were left untried,
    How could the might, that lurks within her, then
    Be shown? her glorious excellence--that ranks                
    Among the first of Powers and Virtues--proved?
    Our system is not fashioned to preclude
    That sympathy which you for others ask;
    And I could tell, not travelling for my theme
    Beyond these humble graves, of grievous crimes               
    And strange disasters; but I pass them by,
    Loth to disturb what Heaven hath hushed in peace.
    --Still less, far less, am I inclined to treat
    Of Man degraded in his Maker's sight
    By the deformities of brutish vice:                          
    For, in such portraits, though a vulgar face
    And a coarse outside of repulsive life
    And unaffecting manners might at once
    Be recognised by all--" "Ah! do not think,"
    The Wanderer somewhat eagerly exclaimed,                     
    "Wish could be ours that you, for such poor gain,
    (Gain shall I call it?--gain of what?--for whom?)
    Should breathe a word tending to violate
    Your own pure spirit. Not a step we look for
    In slight of that forbearance and reserve                    
    Which common human-heartedness inspires,
    And mortal ignorance and frailty claim,
    Upon this sacred ground, if nowhere else."

      "True," said the Solitary, "be it far
    From us to infringe the laws of charity.                     
    Let judgment here in mercy be pronounced;
    This, self-respecting Nature prompts, and this
    Wisdom enjoins; but if the thing we seek
    Be genuine knowledge, bear we then in mind
    How, from his lofty throne, the sun can fling                
    Colours as bright on exhalations bred
    By weedy pool or pestilential swamp,
    As by the rivulet sparkling where it runs,
    Or the pellucid lake."
                            "Small risk," said I,
    "Of such illusion do we here incur;                          
    Temptation here is none to exceed the truth;
    No evidence appears that they who rest
    Within this ground, were covetous of praise,
    Or of remembrance even, deserved or not.
    Green is the Church-yard, beautiful and green,               
    Ridge rising gently by the side of ridge,
    A heaving surface, almost wholly free
    From interruption of sepulchral stones,
    And mantled o'er with aboriginal turf
    And everlasting flowers.These Dalesmen trust            
    The lingering gleam of their departed lives
    To oral record, and the silent heart;
    Depositories faithful and more kind
    Than fondest epitaph: for, if those fail,
    What boots the sculptured tomb? And who can blame,
    Who rather would not envy, men that feel                     
    This mutual confidence; if, from such source,
    The practice flow,--if thence, or from a deep
    And general humility in death?
    Nor should I much condemn it, if it spring            
    From disregard of time's destructive power,
    As only capable to prey on things
    Of earth, and human nature's mortal part.

      "Yet--in less simple districts, where we see
    Stone lift its forehead emulous of stone
    In courting notice; and the ground all paved
    With commendations of departed worth;
    Reading, where'er we turn, of innocent lives,
    Of each domestic charity fulfilled,
    And sufferings meekly borne--I, for my part,              
    Though with the silence pleased that here prevails,
    Among those fair recitals also range,
    Soothed by the natural spirit which they breathe.
    And, in the centre of a world whose soil
    Is rank with all unkindness, compassed round                 
    With such memorials, I have sometimes felt,
    It was no momentary happiness
    To have _one_ Enclosure where the voice that speaks
    In envy or detraction is not heard;
    Which malice may not enter; where the traces                 
    Of evil inclinations are unknown;
    Where love and pity tenderly unite
    With resignation; and no jarring tone
    Intrudes, the peaceful concert to disturb
    Of amity and gratitude."
                              "Thus sanctioned,"                 
    The Pastor said, "I willingly confine
    My narratives to subjects that excite
    Feelings with these accordant; love, esteem,
    And admiration; lifting up a veil,
    A sunbeam introducing among hearts                           
    Retired and covert; so that ye shall have
    Clear images before your gladdened eyes
    Of nature's unambitious underwood,
    And flowers that prosper in the shade. And when
    I speak of such among my flock as swerved                    
    Or fell, those only shall be singled out
    Upon whose lapse, or error, something more
    Than brotherly forgiveness may attend;
    To such will we restrict our notice, else
    Better my tongue were mute.
                                "And yet there are,              
    I feel, good reasons why we should not leave
    Wholly untraced a more forbidding way.
    For, strength to persevere and to support,
    And energy to conquer and repel--
    These elements of virtue, that declare                       
    The native grandeur of the human soul--
    Are oft-times not unprofitably shown
    In the perverseness of a selfish course:
    Truth every day exemplified, no less
    In the grey cottage by the murmuring stream                  
    Than in fantastic conqueror's roving camp,
    Or 'mid the factious senate unappalled
    Whoe'er may sink, or rise--to sink again,
    As merciless proscription ebbs and flows.

      "There," said the Vicar, pointing as he spake,             
    "A woman rests in peace; surpassed by few
    In power of mind, and eloquent discourse.
    Tall was her stature; her complexion dark
    And saturnine; her head not raised to hold
    Converse with heaven, nor yet deprest towards earth,
    But in projection carried, as she walked
    For ever musing. Sunken were her eyes;
    Wrinkled and furrowed with habitual thought
    Was her broad forehead; like the brow of one
    Whose visual nerve shrinks from a painful glare              
    Of overpowering light.--While yet a child,
    She, 'mid the humble flowerets of the vale,
    Towered like the imperial thistle, not unfurnished
    With its appropriate grace, yet rather seeking
    To be admired, than coveted and loved.                       
    Even at that age she ruled, a sovereign queen,
    Over her comrades; else their simple sports,
    Wanting all relish for her strenuous mind,
    Had crossed her only to be shunned with scorn.
    --Oh! pang of sorrowful regret for those
    Whom, in their youth, sweet study has enthralled,
    That they have lived for harsher servitude,
    Whether in soul, in body, or estate!
    Such doom was hers; yet nothing could subdue
    Her keen desire of knowledge, nor efface
    Those brighter images by books imprest
    Upon her memory, faithfully as stars
    That occupy their places, and, though oft
    Hidden by clouds, and oft bedimmed by haze,
    Are not to be extinguished, nor impaired.

      "Two passions, both degenerate, for they both
    Began in honour, gradually obtained
    Rule over her, and vexed her daily life;
    An unremitting, avaricious thrift;
    And a strange thraldom of maternal love,                     
    That held her spirit, in its own despite,
    Bound--by vexation, and regret, and scorn,
    Constrained forgiveness, and relenting vows,
    And tears, in pride suppressed, in shame concealed--
    To a poor dissolute Son, her only child.                     
    --Her wedded days had opened with mishap,
    Whence dire dependence. What could she perform
    To shake the burthen off? Ah! there was felt,
    Indignantly, the weakness of her sex.
    She mused, resolved, adhered to her resolve;                 
    The hand grew slack in alms-giving, the heart
    Closed by degrees to charity; heaven's blessing
    Not seeking from that source, she placed her trust
    In ceaseless pains--and strictest parsimony
    Which sternly hoarded all that could be spared,              
    From each day's need, out of each day's least gain.

      "Thus all was re-established, and a pile
    Constructed, that sufficed for every end,
    Save the contentment of the builder's mind;
    A mind by nature indisposed to aught                         
    So placid, so inactive, as content;
    A mind intolerant of lasting peace,
    And cherishing the pang her heart deplored.
    Dread life of conflict! which I oft compared
    To the agitation of a brook that runs                        
    Down a rocky mountain, buried now and lost
    In silent pools, now in strong eddies chained;
    But never to be charmed to gentleness:
    Its best attainment fits of such repose
    As timid eyes might shrink from fathoming.

      "A sudden illness seized her in the strength
    Of life's autumnal season.--Shall I tell
    How on her bed of death the Matron lay,
    To Providence submissive, so she thought;
    But fretted, vexed, and wrought upon, almost             
    To anger, by the malady that griped
    Her prostrate frame with unrelaxing power,
    As the fierce eagle fastens on the lamb?
    She prayed, she moaned;--her husband's sister watched
    Her dreary pillow, waited on her needs;                    
    And yet the very sound of that kind foot
    Was anguish to her ears! 'And must she rule,'
    This was the death-doomed Woman heard to say
    In bitterness, 'and must she rule and reign,
    'Sole Mistress of this house, when I am gone?                
    'Tend what I tended, calling it her own!'
    Enough;--I fear, too much.--One vernal evening,
    While she was yet in prime of health and strength,
    I well remember, while I passed her door
    Alone, with loitering step, and upward eye              
    Turned towards the planet Jupiter that hung
    Above the centre of the Vale, a voice
    Roused me, her voice; it said, 'That glorious star
    'In its untroubled element will shine
    'As now it shines, when we are laid in earth                 
    'And safe from all our sorrows.' With a sigh
    She spake, yet, I believe, not unsustained
    By faith in glory that shall far transcend
    Aught by these perishable heavens disclosed
    To sight or mind. Nor less than care divine                  
    Is divine mercy. She, who had rebelled,
    Was into meekness softened and subdued;
    Did, after trials not in vain prolonged,
    With resignation sink into the grave;
    And her uncharitable acts, I trust,                     
    And harsh unkindnesses are all forgiven,
    Tho', in this Vale, remembered with deep awe."

    The Vicar paused; and toward a seat advanced,
    A long stone-seat, fixed in the Church-yard wall;
    Part shaded by cool sycamore, and part                       
    Offering a sunny resting-place to them
    Who seek the House of worship, while the bells
    Yet ring with all their voices, or before
    The last hath ceased its solitary knoll.
    Beneath the shade we all sate down; and there           
    His office, uninvited, he resumed.

      "As on a sunny bank, a tender lamb
    Lurks in safe shelter from the winds of March,
    Screened by its parent, so that little mound
    Lies guarded by its neighbour; the small heap                
    Speaks for itself; an Infant there doth rest;
    The sheltering hillock is the Mother's grave.
    If mild discourse, and manners that conferred
    A natural dignity on humblest rank;
    If gladsome spirits, and benignant looks,                    
    That for a face not beautiful did more
    Than beauty for the fairest face can do;
    And if religious tenderness of heart,
    Grieving for sin, and penitential tears
    Shed when the clouds had gathered and distained              
    The spotless ether of a maiden life;
    If these may make a hallowed spot of earth
    More holy in the sight of God or Man;
    Then, o'er that mould, a sanctity shall brood
    Till the stars sicken at the day of doom.                    

      "Ah! what a warning for a thoughtless man,
    Could field or grove, could any spot of earth,
    Show to his eye an image of the pangs
    Which it hath witnessed; render back an echo
    Of the sad steps by which it hath been trod!                 
    There, by her innocent Baby's precious grave,
    And on the very turf that roofs her own,
    The Mother oft was seen to stand, or kneel
    In the broad day, a weeping Magdalene.
    Now she is not; the swelling turf reports                   
    Of the fresh shower, but of poor Ellen's tears
    Is silent; nor is any vestige left
    Of the path worn by mournful tread of her
    Who, at her heart's light bidding, once had moved
    In virgin fearlessness, with step that seemed
    Caught from the pressure of elastic turf
    Upon the mountains gemmed with morning dew,
    In the prime hour of sweetest scents and airs.
    --Serious and thoughtful was her mind; and yet,
    By reconcilement exquisite and rare,                         
    The form, port, motions, of this Cottage-girl
    Were such as might have quickened and inspired
    A Titian's hand, addrest to picture forth
    Oread or Dryad glancing through the shade
    What time the hunter's earliest horn is heard                
    Startling the golden hills.
                                 "A wide-spread elm
    Stands in our valley, named THE JOYFUL TREE;
    From dateless usage which our peasants hold
    Of giving welcome to the first of May
    By dances round its trunk.--And if the sky                   
    Permit, like honours, dance and song, are paid
    To the Twelfth Night, beneath the frosty stars
    Or the clear moon. The queen of these gay sports,
    If not in beauty yet in sprightly air,
    Was hapless Ellen.--No one touched the ground                
    So deftly, and the nicest maiden's locks
    Less gracefully were braided;--but this praise,
    Methinks, would better suit another place.

      "She loved, and fondly deemed herself beloved.
    --The road is dim, the current unperceived,                  
    The weakness painful and most pitiful,
    By which a virtuous woman, in pure youth,
    May be delivered to distress and shame.
    Such fate was hers.--The last time Ellen danced,
    Among her equals, round THE JOYFUL TREE,                     
    She bore a secret burthen; and full soon
    Was left to tremble for a breaking vow,--
    Then, to bewail a sternly-broken vow,
    Alone, within her widowed Mother's house.
    It was the season of unfolding leaves,                       
    Of days advancing toward their utmost length,
    And small birds singing happily to mates
    Happy as they. With spirit-saddening power
    Winds pipe through fading woods; but those blithe notes
    Strike the deserted to the heart; I speak                    
    Of what I know, and what we feel within.
    --Beside the cottage in which Ellen dwelt
    Stands a tall ash-tree; to whose topmost twig
    A thrush resorts, and annually chants,
    At morn and evening from that naked perch,                  
    While all the undergrove is thick with leaves,
    A time-beguiling ditty, for delight
    Of his fond partner, silent in the nest.
    --'Ah why,' said Ellen, sighing to herself,
    'Why do not words, and kiss, and solemn pledge;             
    And nature that is kind in woman's breast,
    And reason that in man is wise and good,
    And fear of him who is a righteous judge;
    Why do not these prevail for human life,
    To keep two hearts together, that began                      
    Their spring-time with one love, and that have need
    Of mutual pity and forgiveness, sweet
    To grant, or be received; while that poor bird--
    O come and hear him! Thou who hast to me
    Been faithless, hear him, though a lowly creature,
    One of God's simple children that yet know not               
    The universal Parent, how he sings
    As if he wished the firmament of heaven
    Should listen, and give back to him the voice
    Of his triumphant constancy and love;                        
    The proclamation that he makes, how far
    His darkness doth transcend our fickle light!'

      "Such was the tender passage, not by me
    Repeated without loss of simple phrase,
    Which I perused, even as the words had been                  
    Committed by forsaken Ellen's hand
    To the blank margin of a Valentine,
    Bedropped with tears. 'Twill please you to be told
    That, studiously withdrawing from the eye
    Of all companionship, the Sufferer yet                       
    In lonely reading found a meek resource:
    How thankful for the warmth of summer days,
    When she could slip into the cottage-barn,
    And find a secret oratory there;
    Or, in the garden, under friendly veil                       
    Of their long twilight, pore upon her book
    By the last lingering help of the open sky
    Until dark night dismissed her to her bed!
    Thus did a waking fancy sometimes lose
    The unconquerable pang of despised love.

      "A kindlier passion opened on her soul
    When that poor Child was born. Upon its face
    She gazed as on a pure and spotless gift
    Of unexpected promise, where a grief
    Or dread was all that had been thought of,--joy           
    Far livelier than bewildered traveller feels,
    Amid a perilous waste that all night long
    Hath harassed him toiling through fearful storm,
    When he beholds the first pale speck serene
    Of day-spring, in the gloomy east, revealed,              
    And greets it with thanksgiving. 'Till this hour,'
    Thus, in her Mother's hearing Ellen spake,
    'There was a stony region in my heart;
    'But He, at whose command the parched rock
    'Was smitten, and poured forth a quenching stream,
    'Hath softened that obduracy, and made                      
    'Unlooked-for gladness in the desert place,
    'To save the perishing; and, henceforth, I breathe
    'The air with cheerful spirit, for thy sake
    'My Infant! and for that good Mother dear,           
    'Who bore me; and hath prayed for me in vain;--
    'Yet not in vain; it shall not be in vain.'
    She spake, nor was the assurance unfulfilled;
    And if heart-rending thoughts would oft return,
    They stayed not long.--The blameless Infant grew;
    The Child whom Ellen and her Mother loved                    
    They soon were proud of; tended it and nursed;
    A soothing comforter, although forlorn;
    Like a poor singing-bird from distant lands;
    Or a choice shrub, which he, who passes by                   
    With vacant mind, not seldom may observe
    Fair-flowering in a thinly-peopled house,
    Whose window, somewhat sadly, it adorns.

      "Through four months' space the Infant drew its food
    From the maternal breast; then scruples rose;                
    Thoughts, which the rich are free from, came and crossed
    The fond affection. She no more could bear
    By her offence to lay a two-fold weight
    On a kind parent willing to forget
    Their slender means: so, to that parent's care               
    Trusting her child, she left their common home,
    And undertook with dutiful content
    A Foster-mother's office.
                              "'Tis, perchance,
    Unknown to you that in these simple vales
    The natural feeling of equality                              
    Is by domestic service unimpaired
    Yet, though such service be, with us, removed
    From sense of degradation, not the less
    The ungentle mind can easily find means
    To impose severe restraints and laws unjust,              
    Which hapless Ellen now was doomed to feel:
    For (blinded by an over-anxious dread
    Of such excitement and divided thought
    As with her office would but ill accord)
    The pair, whose infant she was bound to nurse,              
    Forbad her all communion with her own:
    Week after week, the mandate they enforced.
    --So near! yet not allowed, upon that sight
    To fix her eyes-alas! 'twas hard to bear!
    But worse affliction must be borne--far worse;               
    For 'tis Heaven's will--that, after a disease
    Begun and ended within three days' space,
    Her child should die; as Ellen now exclaimed,
    Her own--deserted child!--Once, only once,
    She saw it in that mortal malady;                            
    And, on the burial-day, could scarcely gain
    Permission to attend its obsequies.
    She reached the house, last of the funeral train;
    And some one, as she entered, having chanced
    To urge unthinkingly their prompt departure,                 
    'Nay,' said she, with commanding look, a spirit
    Of anger never seen in her before,
    'Nay, ye must wait my time!' and down she sate,
    And by the unclosed coffin kept her seat
    Weeping and looking, looking on and weeping,                 
    Upon the last sweet slumber of her Child,
    Until at length her soul was satisfied.

      "You see the Infant's Grave; and to this spot,
    The Mother, oft as she was sent abroad,
    On whatsoever errand, urged her steps:                       
    Hither she came; here stood, and sometimes knelt
    In the broad day, a rueful Magdalene!
    So call her; for not only she bewailed
    A mother's loss, but mourned in bitterness
    Her own transgression; penitent sincere                      
    As ever raised to heaven a streaming eye!
    --At length the parents of the foster-child,
    Noting that in despite of their commands
    She still renewed and could not but renew
    Those visitations, ceased to send her forth;                 
    Or, to the garden's narrow bounds, confined.
    I failed not to remind them that they erred;
    For holy Nature might not thus be crossed,
    Thus wronged in woman's breast: in vain I pleaded--
    But the green stalk of Ellen's life was snapped,            
    And the flower drooped; as every eye could see,
    It hung its head in mortal languishment.
    --Aided by this appearance, I at length
    Prevailed; and, from those bonds released, she went
    Home to her mother's house.
                                "The Youth was fled;            
    The rash betrayer could not face the shame
    Or sorrow which his senseless guilt had caused;
    And little would his presence, or proof given
    Of a relenting soul, have now availed;
    For, like a shadow, he was passed away                      
    From Ellen's thoughts; had perished to her mind
    For all concerns of fear, or hope, or love,
    Save only those which to their common shame,
    And to his moral being appertained:
    Hope from that quarter would, I know, have brought          
    A heavenly comfort; there she recognised
    An unrelaxing bond, a mutual need;
    There, and, as seemed, there only.
                                       "She had built,
    Her fond maternal heart had built, a nest
    In blindness all too near the river's edge;                 
    That work a summer flood with hasty swell
    Had swept away; and now her Spirit longed
    For its last flight to heaven's security.
    --The bodily frame wasted from day to day;
    Meanwhile, relinquishing all other cares,                   
    Her mind she strictly tutored to find peace
    And pleasure in endurance. Much she thought,
    And much she read; and brooded feelingly
    Upon her own unworthiness. To me,
    As to a spiritual comforter and friend,                     
    Her heart she opened; and no pains were spared
    To mitigate, as gently as I could,
    The sting of self-reproach, with healing words.
    Meek Saint! through patience glorified on earth!
    In whom, as by her lonely hearth she sate,                  
    The ghastly face of cold decay put on
    A sun-like beauty, and appeared divine!
    May I not mention--that, within those walls,
    In due observance of her pious wish,
    The congregation joined with me in prayer                   
    For her soul's good? Nor was that office vain.
    --Much did she suffer: but, if any friend,
    Beholding her condition, at the sight
    Gave way to words of pity or complaint,
    She stilled them with a prompt reproof, and said,           
    'He who afflicts me knows what I can bear;
    'And, when I fail, and can endure no more,
    'Will mercifully take me to himself.'
    So, through the cloud of death, her Spirit passed
    Into that pure and unknown world of love                    
    Where injury cannot come:--and here is laid
    The mortal Body by her Infant's side."

    The Vicar ceased; and downcast looks made known
    That each had listened with his inmost heart.
    For me, the emotion scarcely was less strong                
    Or less benign than that which I had felt
    When seated near my venerable Friend,
    Under[616] those shady elms, from him I heard
    The story that retraced the slow decline
    Of Margaret, sinking on the lonely heath                    
    With the neglected house to which she clung.
    --I noted that the Solitary's cheek
    Confessed the power of nature.--Pleased though sad,
    More pleased than sad, the grey-haired Wanderer sate;
    Thanks to his pure imaginative soul                         
    Capacious and serene; his blameless life,
    His knowledge, wisdom, love of truth, and love
    Of human kind! He was it who first broke
    The pensive silence, saying:--
                                  "Blest are they
    Whose sorrow rather is to suffer wrong                      
    Than to do wrong, albeit themselves have erred.
    This tale gives proof that Heaven most gently deals
    With such, in their affliction.--Ellen's fate,
    Her tender spirit, and her contrite heart,
    Call to my mind dark hints which I have heard               
    Of one who died within this vale, by doom
    Heavier, as his offence was heavier far.
    Where, Sir, I pray you, where are laid the bones
    Of Wilfred Armathwaite?"
                              The Vicar answered,
    "In that green nook, close by the Church-yard wall,         
    Beneath yon hawthorn, planted by myself
    In memory and for warning, and in sign
    Of sweetness where dire anguish had been known,
    Of reconcilement after deep offence--
    There doth he rest. No theme his fate supplies              
    For the smooth glozings of the indulgent world;
    Nor need the windings of his devious course
    Be here retraced;--enough that, by mishap
    And venial error, robbed of competence,
    And her obsequious shadow, peace of mind,              
    He craved a substitute in troubled joy;
    Against his conscience rose in arms, and, braving
    Divine displeasure, broke the marriage-vow.
    That which he had been weak enough to do
    Was misery in remembrance; he was stung,                    
    Stung by his inward thoughts, and by the smiles
    Of wife and children stung to agony.
    Wretched at home, he gained no peace abroad;
    Ranged through the mountains, slept upon the earth,
    Asked comfort of the open air, and found                    
    No quiet in the darkness of the night,
    No pleasure in the beauty of the day.
    His flock he slighted: his paternal fields
    Became a clog to him, whose spirit wished
    To fly--but whither! And this gracious Church,              
    That wears a look so full of peace and hope
    And love, benignant mother of the vale,
    How fair amid her brood of cottages!
    She was to him a sickness and reproach.
    Much to the last remained unknown: but this                 
    Is sure, that through remorse and grief he died;
    Though pitied among men, absolved by God,
    He could not find forgiveness in himself;
    Nor could endure the weight of his own shame.

      "Here rests a Mother. But from her I turn                 
    And from her grave.--Behold--upon that ridge,
    That,[621] stretching boldly from the mountain side,
    Carries into the centre of the vale
    Its rocks and woods--the Cottage where she dwelt;
    And where yet dwells her faithful Partner, left             
    (Full eight years past) the solitary prop
    Of many helpless Children. I begin
    With words that might be prelude to a tale
    Of sorrow and dejection; but I feel
    No sadness, when I think of what mine eyes                  
    See daily in that happy family.
    --Bright garland form they for the pensive brow
    Of their undrooping Father's widowhood,
    Those six fair Daughters, budding yet--not one,
    Not one of all the band, a full-blown flower.               
    Deprest, and desolate of soul, as once
    That Father was, and filled with anxious fear,
    Now, by experience taught, he stands assured,
    That God, who takes away, yet takes not half
    Of what he seems to take; or gives it back,                 
    Not to our prayer, but far beyond our prayer;
    He gives it--the boon produce of a soil
    Which our endeavours have refused to till,
    And hope hath never watered. The Abode,
    Whose grateful owner can attest these truths,               
    Even were the object nearer to our sight,
    Would seem in no distinction to surpass
    The rudest habitations. Ye might think
    That it had sprung self-raised from earth, or grown
    Out of the living rock, to be adorned                       
    By nature only; but, if thither led,
    Ye would discover, then, a studious work
    Of many fancies, prompting many hands.

      "Brought from the woods the honeysuckle twines
    Around the porch, and seems, in that trim place,            
    A plant no longer wild; the cultured rose
    There blossoms, strong in health, and will be soon
    Roof-high; the wild pink crowns the garden-wall,
    And with the flowers are intermingled stones
    Sparry and bright, rough scatterings of the hills.     
    These ornaments, that fade not with the year,
    A hardy Girl continues to provide;
    Who, mounting fearlessly the rocky heights,
    Her Father's prompt attendant, does for him
    All that a boy could do, but with delight                   
    More keen and prouder daring; yet hath she,
    Within the garden, like the rest, a bed
    For her own flowers and favourite herbs, a space,
    By sacred charter, holden for her use.
    --These, and whatever else the garden bears                 
    Of fruit or flower, permission asked or not,
    I freely gather; and my leisure draws
    A not unfrequent pastime from the hum
    Of bees around their range of sheltered hives
    Busy in that enclosure; while the rill,
    That sparkling thrids the rocks, attunes his voice
    To the pure course of human life which there
    Flows on in solitude. But, when the gloom
    Of night is falling round my steps, then most
    This Dwelling charms me; often I stop short,
    (Who could refrain?) and feed by stealth my sight
    With prospect of the company within,
    Laid open through the blazing window:--there
    I see the eldest Daughter at her wheel
    Spinning amain, as if to overtake                           
    The never-halting time; or, in her turn,
    Teaching some Novice of the sisterhood
    That skill in this or other household work,
    Which, from her Father's honoured hand, herself,
    While she was yet a little-one, had learned.                
    Mild Man! he is not gay, but they are gay;
    And the whole house seems filled with gaiety.
    --Thrice happy, then, the Mother may be deemed,
    The Wife, from whose consolatory grave
    I turned, that ye in mind might witness where,             
    And how, her Spirit yet survives on earth!"

      "The next three Ridges--those upon the left--
    By close connexion with our present thoughts
    Tempt me to add, in praise of humble worth,
    Their brief and unobtrusive history.                        
    --One Hillock, ye may note, is small and low,
    Sunk almost to a level with the plain
    By weight of time; the Others, undepressed,
    Are bold and swelling. There a Husband sleeps,
    Deposited, in pious confidence                              
    Of glorious resurrection with the just,
    Near the loved Partner of his early days;
    And, in the bosom of that family mold,
    A second Wife is gathered to his side;
    The approved Assistant of an arduous course                 
    From his mid noon of manhood to old age!
    He also of his Mate deprived, was left
    Alone--'mid many Children; One a Babe
    Orphaned as soon as born. Alas! 'tis not
    In course of nature that a Father's wing                    
    Should warm these Little-ones; and can he _feed_?
    That was a thought of agony more keen.
    For, hand in hand with Death, by strange mishap
    And chance-encounter on their diverse road,
    The ghastlier shape of Poverty had entered                  
    Into that House, unfeared and unforeseen.
    He had stepped forth, in time of urgent need,
    The generous Surety of a Friend: and now
    The widowed Father found that all his rights
    In his paternal fields were undermined.                     
    Landless he was and pennyless.--The dews
    Of night and morn that wet the mountain sides,
    The bright stars twinkling on their dusky tops,
    Were conscious of the pain that drove him forth
    From his own door, he knew not when--to range               
    He knew not where; distracted was his brain,
    His heart was cloven; and full oft he prayed,
    In blind despair, that God would take them all.
    --But suddenly, as if in one kind moment
    To encourage and reprove, a gleam of light                  
    Broke from the very bosom of that cloud
    Which darkened the whole prospect of his days.
    For He, who now possessed the joyless right
    To force the Bondsman from his house and lands,
    In pity, and by admiration urged                            
    Of his unmurmuring and considerate mind
    Meekly submissive to the law's decree,
    Lightened the penalty with liberal hand.
    --The desolate Father raised his head, and looked
    On the wide world in hope. Within these walls,              
    In course of time was solemnized the vow
    Whereby a virtuous Woman, of grave years
    And of prudential habits, undertook
    The sacred office of a wife to him,
    Of Mother to his helpless family.                           
    --Nor did she fail, in nothing did she fail,
    Through various exercise of twice ten years,
    Save in some partial fondness for that Child
    Which at the birth she had received, the Babe
    Whose heart had known no Mother but herself.               
    --By mutual efforts; by united hopes;
    By daily-growing help of boy and girl,
    Trained early to participate that zeal
    Of industry, which runs before the day
    And lingers after it; by strong restraint                   
    Of an economy which did not check
    The heart's more generous motions tow'rds themselves
    Or to their neighbours; and by trust in God;
    This Pair insensibly subdued the fears
    And troubles that beset their life: and thus                
    Did the good Father and his second Mate
    Redeem at length their plot of smiling fields.
    These, at this day, the eldest Son retains:
    The younger Offspring, through the busy world
    Have all been scattered wide, by various fates;             
    But each departed from the native Vale,
    In beauty flourishing, and moral worth."
