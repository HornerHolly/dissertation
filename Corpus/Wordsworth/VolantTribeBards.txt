A volant Tribe of Bards on earth are found,
    Who, while the flattering Zephyrs round them play,
    On "coignes of vantage" hang their nests of clay;
    How quickly from that aery hold unbound,
    Dust for oblivion! To the solid ground                             
    Of nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye;
    Convinced that there, there only, she can lay
    Secure foundations. As the year runs round,
    Apart she toils within the chosen ring;
    While the stars shine, or while day's purple eye             
    Is gently closing with the flowers of spring;
    Where even the motion of an Angels wing
    Would interrupt the intense tranquillity
    Of silent hills, and more than silent sky.
