 How beautiful your presence, how benign,
    Servants of God! who not a thought will share
    With the vain world; who, outwardly as bare
    As winter trees, yield no fallacious sign
    That the firm soul is clothed with fruit divine!                   
    Such Priest, when service worthy of his care
    Has called him forth to breathe the common air,
    Might seem a saintly Image from its shrine
    Descended:--happy are the eyes that meet
    The Apparition; evil thoughts are stayed                          
    At his approach, and low-bowed necks entreat
    A benediction from his voice or hand;
    Whence grace, through which the heart can understand,
    And vows, that bind the will, in silence made.
