 Down a swift Stream, thus far, a bold design
    Have we pursued, with livelier stir of heart
    Than his who sees, borne forward by the Rhine,
    The living landscapes greet him, and depart;
    Sees spires fast sinking--up again to start!                       
    And strives the towers to number, that recline
    O'er the dark steeps, or on the horizon line
    Striding with shattered crests his eye athwart.
    So have we hurried on with troubled pleasure:
    Henceforth, as on the bosom of a stream                           
    That slackens, and spreads wide a watery gleam,
    We, nothing loth a lingering course to measure,
    May gather up our thoughts, and mark at leisure
    How widely spread the interests of our theme.
