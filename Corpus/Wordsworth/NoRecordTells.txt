No record tells of lance opposed to lance,
    Horse charging horse, 'mid these retired domains;
    Tells that their turf drank purple from the veins
    Of heroes, fallen, or struggling to advance,
    Till doubtful combat issued in a trance                        
    Of victory, that struck through heart and reins
    Even to the inmost seat of mortal pains,
    And lightened o'er the pallid countenance.
    Yet, to the loyal and the brave, who lie
    In the blank earth, neglected and forlorn,                    
    The passing Winds memorial tribute pay;
    The Torrents chant their praise, inspiring scorn
    Of power usurped; with proclamation high,
    And glad acknowledgment, of lawful sway.
