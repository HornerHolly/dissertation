    Pause, courteous Spirit!--Balbi supplicates
    That Thou, with no reluctant voice, for him
    Here laid in mortal darkness, wouldst prefer
    A prayer to the Redeemer of the world.
    This to the dead by sacred right belongs;                    
    All else is nothing.--Did occasion suit
    To tell his worth, the marble of this tomb
    Would ill suffice: for Plato's lore sublime,
    And all the wisdom of the Stagyrite,
    Enriched and beautified his studious mind:                  
    With Archimedes also he conversed
    As with a chosen friend; nor did he leave
    Those laureat wreaths ungathered which the Nymphs
    Twine near their loved Permessus.--Finally,
    Himself above each lower thought uplifting,                 
    His ears he closed to listen to the songs
    Which Sion's Kings did consecrate of old;
    And his Permessus found on Lebanon.
    A bless√®d Man! who of protracted days
    Made not, as thousands do, a vulgar sleep;                 
    But truly did _He_ live his life. Urbino,
    Take pride in him!--O Passenger, farewell!
