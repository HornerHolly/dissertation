 Broken in fortune, but in mind entire
    And sound in principle, I seek repose
    Where ancient trees this convent-pile enclose,
    In ruin beautiful. When vain desire
    Intrudes on peace, I pray the eternal Sire                         
    To cast a soul-subduing shade on me,
    A grey-haired, pensive, thankful Refugee;
    A shade but with some sparks of heavenly fire
    Once to these cells vouchsafed And when I note
    The old Tower's brow yellowed as with the beams                   
    Of sunset ever there, albeit streams
    Of stormy weather stains that semblance wrought,
    I thank the silent Monitor, and say
    Shine so, my aged brow, at all hours of the day
