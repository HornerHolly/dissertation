Within her gilded cage confined,
    I saw a dazzling Belle,
    A Parrot of that famous kind
    Whose name is NON-PAREIL.

    Like beads of glossy jet her eyes;                                 
    And, smoothed by Nature's skill,
    With pearl or gleaming agate vies
    Her finely-curv√®d bill.

    Her plumy mantle's living hues
    In mass opposed to mass,                                          
    Outshine the splendour that imbues
    The robes of pictured glass.

    And, sooth to say, an apter Mate
    Did never tempt the choice
    Of feathered Thing most delicate                                  
    In figure and in voice.

    But, exiled from Australian bowers,
    And singleness her lot,
    She trills her song with tutored powers,
    Or mocks each casual note.                                        

    No more of pity for regrets
    With which she may have striven!
    Now but in wantonness she frets,
    Or spite, if cause be given;

    Arch, volatile, a sportive bird                                   
    By social glee inspired;
    Ambitious to be seen or heard
    And pleased to be admired!

    This Moss-Lined shed, green, soft, and dry,
    Harbours a self-contented Wren,                                   
    Not shunning man's abode, though shy,
    Almost as thought itself, of human ken.

    Strange places, coverts unendeared,
    She never tried; the very nest
    In which this Child of Spring was reared,                         
    Is warmed, thro' winter, by her feathery breast.

    To the bleak winds she sometimes gives
    A slender unexpected strain;
    Proof that the hermitess still lives,
    Though she appear not, and be sought in vain.                     

    Say, Dora! tell me, by yon placid moon,
    If called to choose between the favoured pair,
    Which would you be,--the bird of the saloon,
    By lady-fingers tended with nice care,
    Caressed, applauded, upon dainties fed,                           
    Or Nature's DARKLING of this mossy shed?
