    Unless to Peter's Chair the viewless wind
    Must come and ask permission when to blow,
    What further empire would it have? for now
    A ghostly Domination, unconfined
    As that by dreaming Bards to Love assigned,                        
    Sits there in sober truth--to raise the low,
    Perplex the wise, the strong to overthrow;
    Through earth and heaven to bind and to unbind!--
    Resist--the thunder quails thee!--crouch--rebuff
    Shall be thy recompense! from land to land                        
    The ancient thrones of Christendom are stuff
    For occupation of a magic wand,
    And 'tis the Pope that wields it:--whether rough
    Or smooth his front, our world is in his hand!
