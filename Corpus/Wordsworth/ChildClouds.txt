Child of the clouds! remote from every taint
    Of sordid industry thy lot is cast;
    Thine are the honours of the lofty waste;
    Not seldom, when with heat the valleys faint,
    Thy handmaid Frost with spangled tissue quaint                 
    Thy cradle decks;--to chant thy birth, thou hast
    No meaner Poet than the whistling Blast,
    And Desolation is thy Patron-saint!
    She guards thee, ruthless Power! who would not spare
    Those mighty forests, once the bison's screen,                
    Where stalked the huge deer to his shaggy lair
    Through paths and alleys roofed with darkest green
    Thousands of years before the silent air
    Was pierced by whizzing shaft of hunter keen!
