 High on her speculative tower
    Stood Science waiting for the hour
    When Sol was destined to endure
    _That_ darkening of his radiant face
    Which Superstition strove to chase,                            
    Erewhile, with rites impure.

    Afloat beneath Italian skies,
    Through regions fair as Paradise
    We gaily passed,--till Nature wrought
    A silent and unlooked-for change,                             
    That checked the desultory range
    Of joy and sprightly thought.

    Where'er was dipped the toiling oar,
    The waves danced round us as before,
    As lightly, though of altered hue,                            
    'Mid recent coolness, such as falls
    At noontide from umbrageous walls
    That screen the morning dew.

    No vapour stretched its wings; no cloud
    Cast far or near a murky shroud;                              
    The sky an azure field displayed;
    'Twas sunlight sheathed and gently charmed,
    Of all its sparkling rays disarmed,
    And as in slumber laid,--

    Or something night and day between,                           
    Like moonshine--but the hue was green;
    Still moonshine, without shadow, spread
    On jutting rock, and curvèd shore,
    Where gazed the peasant from his door
    And on the mountain's head.                                   

    It tinged the Julian steeps--it lay,
    Lugano! on thy ample bay,
    The solemnizing veil was drawn
    O'er villas, terraces, and towers;
    To Albogasio's olive bowers,                              
    Porlezza's verdant lawn.

    But Fancy with the speed of fire
    Hath past to Milan's loftiest spire,
    And there alights 'mid that aërial host
    Of Figures human and divine,                                 
    White as the snows of Apennine
    Indúrated by frost.

    Awe-stricken she beholds the array
    That guards the Temple night and day;
    Angels she sees--that might from heaven have flown,
    And Virgin-saints, who not in vain                            
    Have striven by purity to gain
    The beatific crown--

    Sees long-drawn files, concentric rings
    Each narrowing above each;--the wings,                        
    The uplifted palms, the silent marble lips
    The starry zone of sovereign height--
    All steeped in this portentous light!
    All suffering dim eclipse!

    Thus after Man had fallen (if aught                           
    These perishable spheres have wrought
    May with that issue be compared)
    Throngs of celestial visages,
    Darkening like water in the breeze,
    A holy sadness shared.                                        

    Lo! while I speak, the labouring Sun
    His glad deliverance has begun:
    The cypress waves her sombre plume
    More cheerily; and town and tower,
    The vineyard and the olive-bower,                             
    Their lustre re-assume!

    O Ye, who guard and grace my home
    While in far-distant lands we roam,
    What countenance hath this Day put on for you?
    While we looked round with favoured eyes,                     
    Did sullen mists hide lake and skies
    And mountains from your view?

    Or was it given you to behold
    Like vision, pensive though not cold,
    From the smooth breast of gay Winandermere?
    Saw ye the soft yet awful veil                                
    Spread over Grasmere's lovely dale,
    Helvellyn's brow severe?

    I ask in vain--and know far less
    If sickness, sorrow, or distress                              
    Have spared my Dwelling to this hour;
    Sad blindness! but ordained to prove
    Our faith in Heaven's unfailing love
    And all-controlling power.
