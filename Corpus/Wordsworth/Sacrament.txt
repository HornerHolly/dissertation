 By chain yet stronger must the Soul be tied:
    One duty more, last stage of this ascent,
    Brings to thy food, mysterious Sacrament!
    The Offspring, haply at the Parent's side;
    But not till They, with all that do abide                          
    In Heaven, have lifted up their hearts to laud
    And magnify the glorious name of God,
    Fountain of Grace, whose Son for sinners died.
    Ye, who have duly weighed the summons, pause
    No longer; ye,whom to the saving rite                       
    The Altar calls; come early under laws
    That can secure for you a path of light
    Through gloomiest shade; put on (nor dread its weight)
    Armour divine, and conquer in your cause!
