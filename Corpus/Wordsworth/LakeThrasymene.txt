    When here with Carthage Rome to conflict came,
    An earthquake, mingling with the battle’s shock,
    Checked not its rage; unfelt the ground did rock,
    Sword dropped not, javelin kept its deadly aim.--
    Now all is sun-bright peace. Of that day’s shame,                  
    Or glory, not a vestige seems to endure,
    Save in this Rill that took from blood the name 
    Which yet it bears, sweet Stream! as crystal pure.
    So may all trace and sign of deeds aloof
    From the true guidance of humanity,                               
    Thro’ Time and Nature’s influence, purify
    Their spirit; or, unless they for reproof
    Or warning serve, thus let them all, on ground
    That gave them being, vanish to a sound.
