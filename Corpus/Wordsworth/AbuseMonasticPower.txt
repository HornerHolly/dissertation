And what is Penance with her knotted thong;
    Mortification with the shirt of hair,
    Wan cheek, and knees ind√∫rated with prayer,
    Vigils, and fastings rigorous as long;
    If cloistered Avarice scruple not to wrong                         
    The pious, humble, useful Secular,
    And rob the people of his daily care,
    Scorning that world whose blindness makes her strong?
    Inversion strange! that, unto One who lives
    For self, and struggles with himself alone,                       
    The amplest share of heavenly favour gives;
    That to a Monk allots, both in the esteem
    Of God and man, place higher than to him 
    Who on the good of others builds his own!
