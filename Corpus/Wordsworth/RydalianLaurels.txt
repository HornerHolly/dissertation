Adieu, Rydalian Laurels! that have grown
    And spread as if ye knew that days might come
    When ye would shelter in a happy home,
    On this fair Mount, a Poet of your own,
    One who ne'er ventured for a Delphic crown                        
    To sue the God; but, haunting your green shade
    All seasons through, is humbly pleased to braid
    Ground-flowers, beneath your guardianship, self-sown.
    Farewell! no Minstrels now with harp new-strung
    For summer wandering quit their household bowers;
    Yet not for this wants Poesy a tongue                             
    To cheer the Itinerant on whom she pours
    Her spirit, while he crosses lonely moors,
    Or musing sits forsaken halls among.
