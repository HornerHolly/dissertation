 Serving no haughty Muse, my hands have here
    Disposed some cultured Flowerets (drawn from spots
    Where they bloomed singly, or in scattered knots),
    Each kind in several beds of one parterre;
    Both to allure the casual Loiterer,                                
    And that, so placed, my Nurslings may requite
    Studious regard with opportune delight,
    Nor be unthanked, unless I fondly err.
    But metaphor dismissed, and thanks apart,
    Reader, farewell! My last words let them be--                     
    If in this book Fancy and Truth agree;
    If simple Nature trained by careful Art
    Through It have won a passage to thy heart;
    Grant me thy love, I crave no other fee!
