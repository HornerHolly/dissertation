 How fast the Marian death-list is unrolled!
    See Latimer and Ridley in the might
    Of Faith stand coupled for a common flight!
    One (like those prophets whom God sent of old)
    Transfigured, from this kindling hath foretold                
    A torch of inextinguishable light;
    The Other gains a confidence as bold;
    And thus they foil their enemy's despite.
    The penal instruments, the shows of crime,
    Are glorified while this once-mitred pair                         
    Of saintly Friends the "murtherer's chain partake,
    Corded, and burning at the social stake:"
    Earth never witnessed object more sublime
    In constancy, in fellowship more fair!
