 "As the cold aspect of a sunless way
    Strikes through the Traveller's frame with deadlier chill,
    Oft as appears a grove, or obvious hill,
    Glistening with unparticipated ray,
    Or shining slope where he must never stray;                    
    So joys, remembered without wish or will,
    Sharpen the keenest edge of present ill,--
    On the crushed heart a heavier burthen lay.
    Just Heaven, contract the compass of my mind
    To fit proportion with my altered state!                      
    Quench those felicities whose light I find
    Reflected in my bosom all too late!--
    O be my spirit, like my thraldom, strait;
    And, like mine eyes that stream with sorrow, blind!"
