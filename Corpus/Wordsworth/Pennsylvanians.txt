 Days undefiled by luxury or sloth,
    Firm self-denial, manners grave and staid,
    Rights equal, laws with cheerfulness obeyed,
    Words that require no sanction from an oath,
    And simple honesty a common growth--                               
    This high repute, with bounteous Nature’s aid,
    Won confidence, now ruthlessly betrayed
    At will, your power the measure of your troth!--
    All who revere the memory of Penn
    Grieve for the land on whose wild woods his name
    Was fondly grafted with a virtuous aim,
    Renounced, abandoned by degenerate Men
    For state-dishonour black as ever came
    To upper air from Mammon’s loathsome den.
