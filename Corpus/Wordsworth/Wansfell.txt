  Wansfell! this Household has a favoured lot,
    Living with liberty on thee to gaze,
    To watch while Morn first crowns thee with her rays,
    Or when along thy breast serenely float
    Evenings angelic clouds. Yet neer a note                         
    Hath sounded shame upon the Bard! thy praise
    For all that thou, as if from heaven, hast brought
    Of glory lavished on our quiet days.
    Bountiful Son of Earth! when we are gone
    From every object dear to mortal sight,                           
    As soon we shall be, may these words attest
    How oft, to elevate our spirits, shone
    Thy visionary majesties of light,
    How in thy pensive glooms our hearts found rest.
