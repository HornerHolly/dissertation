 Mother! whose virgin bosom was uncrost
    With the least shade of thought to sin allied;
    Woman! above all women glorified,
    Our tainted natures solitary boast;
    Purer than foam on central ocean tost;                             
    Brighter than eastern skies at daybreak strewn
    With fancied roses, than the unblemished moon
    Before her wane begins on heavens blue coast;
    Thy Image falls to earth. Yet some, I ween,
    Not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend,                     
    As to a visible Power, in which did blend
    All that was mixed and reconciled in Thee
    Of mothers love with maiden purity,
    Of high with low, celestial with terrene!
