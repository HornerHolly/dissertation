Ah, think how one compelled for life to abide
    Locked in a dungeon needs must eat the heart
    Out of his own humanity, and part
    With every hope that mutual cares provide;
    And, should a less unnatural doom confide                          
    In life-long exile on a savage coast,
    Soon the relapsing penitent may boast
    Of yet more heinous guilt, with fiercer pride.
    Hence thoughtful Mercy, Mercy sage and pure,
    Sanctions the forfeiture that Law demands,                        
    Leaving the final issue in _His_ hands
    Whose goodness knows no change, whose love is sure,
    Who sees, foresees; who cannot judge amiss,
    And wafts at will the contrite soul to bliss.
