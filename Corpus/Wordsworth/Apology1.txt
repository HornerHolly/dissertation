 The formal World relaxes her cold chain
    For One who speaks in numbers; ampler scope
    His utterance finds; and, conscious of the gain,
    Imagination works with bolder hope
    The cause of grateful reason to sustain;                           
    And, serving Truth, the heart more strongly beats
    Against all barriers which his labour meets
    In lofty place, or humble Life domain.
    Enough before us lay a painful road,
    And guidance have I sought in duteous love                        
    From Wisdom heavenly Father. Hence hath flowed
    Patience, with trust that, whatsoever the way
    Each takes in this high matter, all may move
    Cheered with the prospect of a brighter day.
