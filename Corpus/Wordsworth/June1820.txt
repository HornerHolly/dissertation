  Fame tells of groves--from England far away--
   Groves that inspire the Nightingale to trill
    And modulate, with subtle reach of skill
    Elsewhere unmatched, her ever-varying lay;
    Such bold report I venture to gainsay:                         
    For I have heard the quire of Richmond hill
    Chanting, with indefatigable bill,
    Strains that recalled to mind a distant day;
    When, haply under shade of that same wood,
    And scarcely conscious of the dashing oars                    
    Plied steadily between those willowy shores,
    The sweet-souled Poet of the Seasons stood--
    Listening, and listening long, in rapturous mood,
    Ye heavenly Birds! to your Progenitors.
