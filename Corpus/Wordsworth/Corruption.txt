 Sure, it was so. Man in those early days
            Was not all stone and earth;
    He shined a little, and by those weak rays,
            Had some glimpse of his birth.
    He saw Heaven o’er his head, and knew from whence
            He came condemned hither,
    And, as first Love draws strongest, so from hence
            His mind sure progressed thither.”
