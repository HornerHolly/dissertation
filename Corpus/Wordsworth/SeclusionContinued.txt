  Methinks that to some vacant hermitage
    _My_ feet would rather turn--to some dry nook
    Scooped out of living rock, and near a brook
    Hurled down a mountain-cove from stage to stage,
    Yet tempering, for my sight, its bustling rage                     
    In the soft heaven of a translucent pool;
    Thence creeping under sylvan arches cool,
    Fit haunt of shapes whose glorious equipage
    Would elevate my dreams. A beechen bowl,
    A maple dish, my furniture should be;                             
    Crisp, yellow leaves my bed; the hooting owl
    My night-watch: nor should e'er the crested fowl
    From thorp or vill his matins sound for me,
    Tired of the world and all its industry.
