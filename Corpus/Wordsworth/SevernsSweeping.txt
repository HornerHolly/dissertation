    When Severn sweeping flood had overthrown
    St. Mary Church, the preacher then would cry
    Thus, Christian people, God his might hath shown
    That ye to him your love may testify;
    Haste, and rebuild the pile But not a stone                     
    Resumed its place. Age after age went by,
    And Heaven still lacked its due, though piety
    In secret did, we trust, her loss bemoan.
    But now her Spirit hath put forth its claim
    In Power, and Poesy would lend her voice                      
    Let the new Church be worthy of its aim,
    That in its beauty Cardiff may rejoice
    Oh in the past if cause there was for shame,
    Let not our times halt in their better choice.
