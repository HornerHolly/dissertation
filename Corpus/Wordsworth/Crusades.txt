 The turbaned Race are poured in thickening swarms
    Along the west; though driven from Aquitaine,
    The Crescent glitters on the towers of Spain;
    And soft Italia feels renewed alarms;
    The scimitar, that yields not to the charms                        
    Of ease, the narrow Bosphorus will disdain;
    Nor long (that crossed) would Grecian hills detain
    Their tents, and check the current of their arms.
    Then blame not those who, by the mightiest lever
    Known to the moral world, Imagination,                            
    Upheave, so seems it, from her natural station
    All Christendom:--they sweep along (was never
    So huge a host!)--to tear from the Unbeliever
    The precious Tomb, their haven of salvation.
