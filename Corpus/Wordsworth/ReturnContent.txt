Return, Content! for fondly I pursued,
    Even when a child, the Streams unheard, unseen;
    Through tangled woods, impending rocks between;
    Or, free as air, with flying inquest viewed
    The sullen reservoirs whence their bold brood--                
    Pure as the morning, fretful, boisterous, keen,
    Green as the salt-sea billows, white and green--
    Poured down the hills, a choral multitude!
    Nor have I tracked their course for scanty gains;
    They taught me random cares and truant joys,                  
    That shield from mischief and preserve from stains
    Vague minds, while men are growing out of boys;
    Maturer Fancy owes to their rough noise
    Impetuous thoughts that brook not servile reins.
