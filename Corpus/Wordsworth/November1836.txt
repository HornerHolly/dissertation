Even so for me a Vision sanctified
    The sway of Death; long ere mine eyes had seen
    Thy countenance--the still rapture of thy mien--
    When thou, dear Sister! wert become Death’s Bride:
    No trace of pain or languor could abide                            
    That change:--age on thy brow was smoothed--thy cold
    Wan cheek at once was privileged to unfold
    A loveliness to living youth denied.
    Oh! if within me hope should e’er decline,
    The lamp of faith, lost Friend! too faintly burn;                 
    Then may that heaven-revealing smile of thine,
    The bright assurance, visibly return:
    And let my spirit in that power divine
    Rejoice, as, through that power, it ceased to mourn.
