Greta, what fearful listening! when huge stones
    Rumble along thy bed, block after block:
    Or, whirling with reiterated shock,
    Combat, while darkness aggravates the groans:
    But if thou (like Cocytus from the moans
    Heard on his rueful margin) thence wert named
    The Mourner, thy true nature was defamed,
    And the habitual murmur that atones
    For thy worst rage, forgotten. Oft as Spring
    Decks, on thy sinuous banks, her thousand thrones,                
    Seats of glad instinct and love's carolling,
    The concert, for the happy, then may vie
    With liveliest peals of birth-day harmony:
    To a grieved heart, the notes are benisons.
