Complacent Fictions were they, yet the same
    Involved a history of no doubtful sense,
    History that proves by inward evidence
    From what a precious source of truth it came.
    Never could the boldest Eulogist have dared

    To greet with instant faith their loftiest claim.
    None but a noble people could have loved
    Flattery in Ancient Romes pure-minded style:                     
    Not in like sort the Runic Scald was moved;
    He, nursed mid savage passions that defile
    Humanity, sang feats that well might call
    For the blood-thirsty mead of Odin riotous Hall.
