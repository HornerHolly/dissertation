 Aerial Rock--whose solitary brow
    From this low threshold daily meets my sight;
    When I step[360] forth to hail the morning light;
    Or quit the stars with a lingering farewell--how
    Shall Fancy pay to thee a grateful vow?                        
    How, with the Muse's aid, her love attest?
    --By planting on thy naked head the crest
    Of an imperial Castle, which the plough
    Of ruin shall not touch. Innocent scheme!
    That doth presume no more than to supply                      
    A grace the sinuous vale and roaring stream
    Want, through neglect of hoar Antiquity.
    Rise, then, ye votive Towers! and catch a gleam
    Of golden sunset, ere it fade and die.
