Ye, too, must fly before a chasing hand,
    Angels and Saints, in every hamlet mourned!
    Ah! if the old idolatry be spurned,
    Let not your radiant Shapes desert the Land:
    Her adoration was not your demand,                                 
    The fond heart proffered it--the servile heart;
    And therefore are ye summoned to depart,
    Michael, and thou, St. George, whose flaming brand
    The Dragon quelled; and valiant Margaret
    Whose rival sword a like Opponent slew:                           
    And rapt Cecilia, seraph-haunted Queen
    Of harmony; and weeping Magdalene,
    Who in the penitential desert met
    Gales sweet as those that over Eden blew!
