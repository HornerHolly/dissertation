 Methinks that I could trip o'er heaviest soil,
    Light as a buoyant bark from wave to wave,
    Were mine the trusty staff that JEWEL gave
    To youthful HOOKER, in familiar style
    The gift exalting, and with playful smile:             
    For thus equipped, and bearing on his head
    The Donor's farewell blessing, can he dread
    Tempest, or length of way, or weight of toil?--
    More sweet than odours caught by him who sails
    Near spicy shores of Araby the blest,                             
    A thousand times more exquisitely sweet,
    The freight of holy feeling which we meet,
    In thoughtful moments, wafted by the gales
    From fields where good men walk, or bowers wherein they rest.
