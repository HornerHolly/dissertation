Who but is pleased to watch the moon on high
    Travelling where she from time to time enshrouds
    Her head, and nothing loth her Majesty
    Renounces, till among the scattered clouds
    One with its kindling edge declares that soon                      
    Will reappear before the uplifted eye
    A Form as bright, as beautiful a moon,
    To glide in open prospect through clear sky.
    Pity that such a promise e’er should prove
    False in the issue, that yon seeming space                        
    Of sky should be in truth the stedfast face
    Of a cloud flat and dense, through which must move
    (By transit not unlike man’s frequent doom)
    The Wanderer lost in more determined gloom.
