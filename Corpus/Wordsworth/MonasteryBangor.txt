_The oppression of the tumult--wrath and scorn--_
    _The tribulation--and the gleaming blades_--
    Such is the impetuous spirit that pervades
    The song of Taliesin;--Ours shall mourn
    The _unarmed_ Host who by their prayers would turn                 
    The sword from Bangor's walls, and guard the store
    Of Aboriginal and Roman lore,
    And Christian monuments, that now must burn
    To senseless ashes. Mark! how all things swerve
    From their known course, or vanish like a dream;
    Another language spreads from coast to coast;
    Only perchance some melancholy Stream
    And some indignant Hills old names preserve,
    When laws, and creeds, and people all are lost!
