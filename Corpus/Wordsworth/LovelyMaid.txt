 I saw the figure of a lovely Maid
    Seated alone beneath a darksome tree,
    Whose fondly-overhanging canopy
    Set off her brightness with a pleasing shade.
    No Spirit was she; _that_ my heart betrayed,                  
    For she was one I loved exceedingly;
    But while I gazed in tender reverie
    (Or was it sleep that with my Fancy played?)
    The bright corporeal presence--form and face--
    Remaining still distinct grew thin and rare,                      
    Like sunny mist;--at length the golden hair,
    Shape, limbs, and heavenly features, keeping pace
    Each with the other in a lingering race
    Of dissolution, melted into air.
