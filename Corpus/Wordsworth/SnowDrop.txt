  Lone Flower, hemmed in with snows and white as they
    But hardier far, once more I see thee bend
    Thy forehead, as if fearful to offend,
    Like an unbidden guest. Though day by day,
    Storms, sallying from the mountain-tops, way-lay               
    The rising sun, and on the plains descend;
    Yet art thou welcome, welcome as a friend
    Whose zeal outruns his promise! Blue-eyed May
    Shall soon behold this border thickly set
    With bright jonquils, their odours lavishing                  
    On the soft west-wind and his frolic peers;
    Nor will I then thy modest grace forget,
    Chaste Snow-drop, venturous harbinger of Spring,
    And pensive monitor of fleeting years!
