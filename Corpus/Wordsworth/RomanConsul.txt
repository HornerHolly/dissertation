The Roman Consul doomed his sons to die
    Who had betrayed their country. The stern word
    Afforded (may it through all time afford)
    A theme for praise and admiration high.
    Upon the surface of humanity                                      
    He rested not; its depths his mind explored;
    He felt; but his parental bosomâ€™s lord
    Was Duty,--Duty calmed his agony.
    And some, we know, when they by wilful act
    A single human life have wrongly taken,                           
    Pass sentence on themselves, confess the fact,
    And, to atone for it, with soul unshaken
    Kneel at the feet of Justice, and, for faith
    Broken with all mankind, solicit death.
