 Forbear to deem the Chronicler unwise,
    Ungentle, or untouched by seemly ruth,
    Who, gathering up all that Time envious tooth
    Has spared of sound and grave realities,
    Firmly rejects those dazzling flatteries,                          
    Dear as they are to unsuspecting Youth,
    That might have drawn down Clio from the skies
    To vindicate the majesty of truth.
    Such was her office while she walked with men,
    A Muse, who, not unmindful of her Sire                       
    All-ruling Jove, whateer the theme might be
    Revered her Mother, sage Mnemosyne,
    And taught her faithful servants how the lyre
    Should animate, but not mislead, the pen.
