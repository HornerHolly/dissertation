 Darkness surrounds us: seeking, we are lost
    On Snowdon's wilds, amid Brigantian coves,
    Or where the solitary shepherd roves
    Along the plain of Sarum, by the ghost
    Of Time and shadows of Tradition, crost;

    And where the boatman of the Western Isles
    Slackens his course--to mark those holy piles
    Which yet survive on bleak Iona's coast.
    Nor these, nor monuments of eldest name,
    Nor Taliesin's unforgotten lays,                    
    Nor characters of Greek or Roman fame,
    To an unquestionable Source have led;
    Enough--if eyes, that sought the fountain-head
    In vain, upon the growing Rill may gaze.
