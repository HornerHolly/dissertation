 There never breathed a man who, when his life
    Was closing, might not of that life relate
    Toils long and hard.--The warrior will report
    Of wounds, and bright swords flashing in the field,
    And blast of trumpets. He who hath been doomed               
    To bow his forehead in the courts of kings,
    Will tell of fraud and never-ceasing hate,
    Envy and heart-inquietude, derived
    From intricate cabals of treacherous friends.
    I, who on shipboard lived from earliest youth,              
    Could represent the countenance horrible
    Of the vexed waters, and the indignant rage
    Of Auster and Bo√∂tes. Fifty years
    Over the well-steered galleys did I rule:--
    From huge Pelorus to the Atlantic pillars,                  
    Rises no mountain to mine eyes unknown;
    And the broad gulfs I traversed oft and oft:
    Of every cloud which in the heavens might stir
    I knew the force; and hence the rough sea's pride
    Availed not to my Vessel's overthrow.                      
    What noble pomp and frequent have not I
    On regal decks beheld! yet in the end
    I learned that one poor moment can suffice
    To equalise the lofty and the low.
    We sail the sea of life--a _Calm_ One finds,                
    And One a _Tempest_--and, the voyage o'er,
    Death is the quiet haven of us all.
    If more of my condition ye would know,
    Savona was my birth-place, and I sprang
    Of noble parents: seventy years and three                
    Lived I--then yielded to a slow disease.
