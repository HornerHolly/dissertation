 A STREAM, to mingle with your favourite Dee,
    Along the VALE OF MEDITATION flows;
    So styled by those fierce Britons, pleased to see
    In Nature's face the expression of repose;
    Or haply there some pious hermit chose                             
    To live and die, the peace of heaven his aim;
    To whom the wild sequestered region owes,
    At this late day, its sanctifying name.
    GLYN CAFAILLGAROCH, in the Cambrian tongue,
    In ours, the VALE OF FRIENDSHIP, let _this_ spot                  
    Be named; where, faithful to a low-roofed Cot,
    On Deva's banks, ye have abode so long;
    Sisters in love, a love allowed to climb,
    Even on this earth, above the reach of Time!
