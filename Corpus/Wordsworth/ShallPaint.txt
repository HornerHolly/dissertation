  How shall I paint thee?--Be this naked stone
    My seat, while I give way to such intent;
    Pleased could my verse, a speaking monument,
    Make to the eyes of men thy features known.
    But as of all those tripping lambs not one                     
    Outruns his fellows, so hath Nature lent
    To thy beginning nought that doth present
    Peculiar ground for hope to build upon.
    To dignify the spot that gives thee birth,
    No sign of hoar Antiquity's esteem                            
    Appears, and none of modern Fortune's care;
    Yet thou thyself hast round thee shed a gleam
    Of brilliant moss, instinct with freshness rare;
    Prompt offering to thy Foster-mother, Earth!
