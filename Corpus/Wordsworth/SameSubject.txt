Though I beheld at first with blank surprise
    This Work, I now have gazed on it so long
    I see its truth with unreluctant eyes;
    O, my Belov√®d! I have done thee wrong,
    Conscious of blessedness, but, whence it sprung,                   
    Ever too heedless, as I now perceive:
    Morn into noon did pass, noon into eve,
    And the old day was welcome as the young,
    As welcome, and as beautiful--in sooth
    More beautiful, as being a thing more holy:                       
    Thanks to thy virtues, to the eternal youth
    Of all thy goodness, never melancholy;
    To thy large heart and humble mind, that cast
    Into one vision, future, present, past.
