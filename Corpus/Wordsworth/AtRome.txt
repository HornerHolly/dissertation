    Is this, ye Gods, the Capitolian Hill?
    Yon petty Steep in truth the fearful Rock,
    Tarpeian named of yore, and keeping still
    That name, a local Phantom proud to mock
    The Travellers expectation Could our Will
    Destroy the ideal Power within, twere done
    Thro what men see and touch slaves wandering on,
    Impelled by thirst of all but Heaven taught skill.
    Full oft, our wish obtained, deeply we sigh;
    Yet not unrecompensed are they who learn,                         
    From that depression raised, to mount on high
    With stronger wing, more clearly to discern
    Eternal things; and, if need be, defy
    Change, with a brow not insolent, though stern.
