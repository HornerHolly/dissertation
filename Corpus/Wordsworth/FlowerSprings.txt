 O flower of all that springs from gentle blood,
    And all that generous nurture breeds to make
    Youth amiable; O friend so true of soul
    To fair Aglaia; by what envy moved,
    Lelius! has death cut short thy brilliant day                
    In its sweet opening? and what dire mishap
    Has from Savona torn her best delight?
    For thee she mourns, nor e'er will cease to mourn;
    And, should the out-pourings of her eyes suffice not
    For her heart's grief, she will entreat Sebeto              
    Not to withhold his bounteous aid, Sebeto
    Who saw thee, on his margin, yield to death,
    In the chaste arms of thy belov√®d Love!
    What profit riches? what does youth avail?
    Dust are our hopes;--I, weeping bitterly,                   
    Penned these sad lines, nor can forbear to pray
    That every gentle Spirit hither led
    May read them not without some bitter tears.
