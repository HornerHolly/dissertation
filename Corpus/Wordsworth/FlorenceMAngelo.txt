Eternal Lord! eased of a cumbrous load,
    And loosened from the world, I turn to Thee;
    Shun, like a shattered bark, the storm, and flee
    To thy protection for a safe abode.
    The crown of thorns, hands pierced upon the tree,                  
    The meek, benign, and lacerated face,
    To a sincere repentance promise grace,
    To the sad soul give hope of pardon free.
    With justice mark not Thou, O Light divine,
    My fault, nor hear it with thy sacred ear;                        
    Neither put forth that way thy arm severe;
    Wash with thy blood my sins; thereto incline
    More readily the more my years require
    Help, and forgiveness speedy and entire.
