  The wind is now thy organist;--a clank
    (We know not whence) ministers for a bell
    To mark some change of service. As the swell
    Of music reached its height, and even when sank
    The notes, in prelude, ROSLIN! to a blank                          
    Of silence, how it thrilled thy sumptuous roof,
    Pillars, and arches,--not in vain time-proof,
    Though Christian rites be wanting! From what bank
    Came those live herbs? by what hand were they sown
    Where dew falls not, where rain-drops seem unknown?               
    Yet in the Temple they a friendly niche
    Share with their sculptured fellows, that, green-grown,
    Copy their beauty more and more, and preach,
    Though mute, of all things blending into one.
