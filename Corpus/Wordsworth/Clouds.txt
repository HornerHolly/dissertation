    Army of Clouds! ye wingèd Host in troops
    Ascending from behind the motionless brow
    Of that tall rock, as from a hidden world,
    O whither with such eagerness of speed?
    What seek ye, or what shun ye? of the gale
    Companions, fear ye to be left behind,
    Or racing o’er your blue ethereal field
    Contend ye with each other? of the sea
    Children, thus post ye over vale and height
    To sink upon your mother’s lap--and rest?
    Or were ye rightlier hailed, when first mine eyes
    Beheld in your impetuous march the likeness
    Of a wide army pressing on to meet
    Or overtake some unknown enemy?--
    But your smooth motions suit a peaceful aim;                      
    And Fancy, not less aptly pleased, compares
    Your squadrons to an endless flight of birds
    Aerial, upon due migration bound
    To milder climes; or rather do ye urge
    In caravan your hasty pilgrimage                                  
    To pause at last on more aspiring heights
    Than these, and utter your devotion there
    With thunderous voice? Or are ye jubilant,
    And would ye, tracking your proud lord the Sun,
    Be present at his setting; or the pomp                            
    Of Persian mornings would ye fill, and stand
    Poising your splendours high above the heads
    Of worshippers kneeling to their up-risen God?
    Whence, whence, ye Clouds! this eagerness of speed?
    Speak, silent creatures.--They are gone, are fled,                
    Buried together in yon gloomy mass
    That loads the middle heaven; and clear and bright
    And vacant doth the region which they thronged
    Appear; a calm descent of sky conducting
    Down to the unapproachable abyss,                                 
    Down to that hidden gulf from which they rose
    To vanish--fleet as days and months and years,
    Fleet as the generations of mankind,
    Power, glory, empire, as the world itself,
    The lingering world, when time hath ceased to be.                 
    But the winds roar, shaking the rooted trees,
    And see! a bright precursor to a train
    Perchance as numerous, overpeers the rock
    That sullenly refuses to partake
    Of the wild impulse. From a fount of life                         
    Invisible, the long procession moves
    Luminous or gloomy, welcome to the vale
    Which they are entering, welcome to mine eye
    That sees them, to my soul that owns in them,
    And in the bosom of the firmament                                 
    O’er which they move, wherein they are contained,
    A type of her capacious self and all
    Her restless progeny.

                          A humble walk
    Here is my body doomed to tread, this path,
    A little hoary line and faintly traced,
    Work, shall we call it, of the shepherd’s foot
    Or of his flock?--joint vestige of them both.
    I pace it unrepining, for my thoughts
    Admit no bondage and my words have wings.
    Where is the Orphean lyre, or Druid harp,                         
    To accompany the verse? The mountain blast
    Shall be our _hand_ of music; he shall sweep
    The rocks, and quivering trees, and billowy lake,
    And search the fibres of the caves, and they
    Shall answer, for our song is of the Clouds                       
    And the wind loves them; and the gentle gales--
    Which by their aid re-clothe the naked lawn
    With annual verdure, and revive the woods,
    And moisten the parched lips of thirsty flowers--
    Love them; and every idle breeze of air                           
    Bends to the favourite burthen. Moon and stars
    Keep their most solemn vigils when the Clouds
    Watch also, shifting peaceably their place
    Like bands of ministering Spirits, or when they lie,
    As if some Protean art the change had wrought,                    
    In listless quiet o’er the ethereal deep
    Scattered, a Cyclades of various shapes
    And all degrees of beauty. O ye Lightnings!
    Ye are their perilous offspring; and the Sun--
    Source inexhaustible of life and joy,                             
    And type of man’s far-darting reason, therefore
    In old time worshipped as the god of verse,
    A blazing intellectual deity--
    Loves his own glory in their looks, and showers
    Upon that unsubstantial brotherhood                               
    Visions with all but beatific light
    Enriched--too transient were they not renewed
    From age to age, and did not, while we gaze
    In silent rapture, credulous desire
    Nourish the hope that memory lacks not power                     
    To keep the treasure unimpaired. Vain thought!
    Yet why repine, created as we are
    For joy and rest, albeit to find them only
    Lodged in the bosom of eternal things?
