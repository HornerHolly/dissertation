  Grant, that by this unsparing hurricane
    Green leaves with yellow mixed are torn away,
    And goodly fruitage with the mother spray;
    'Twere madness--wished we, therefore, to detain,
    With hands stretched forth in mollified disdain,              
    The "trumpery" that ascends in bare display--
    Bulls, pardons, relics, cowls black, white, and grey--
    Upwhirled, and flying o'er the ethereal plain
    Fast bound for Limbo Lake. And yet not choice
    But habit rules the unreflecting herd,                            
    And airy bonds are hardest to disown;
    Hence, with the spiritual sovereignty transferred
    Unto itself, the Crown assumes a voice
    Of reckless mastery, hitherto unknown.
