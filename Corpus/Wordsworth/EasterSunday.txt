 Erewhile to celebrate this glorious morn
    That saw the unvanquished Saviour of mankind
    Rise from the grave, the Ruler and the Hind
    Put on fresh raiment, till that hour unworn,
    Fair cloth of home-bred wool which he had shorn,
    Her hands had spun, culling her daintiest fleece,
    Such reverence paid they to the Prince of Peace.
    O blest estate, when Piety sublime
    These humble props disdained not! Are thy flowers
    Banished for aye, from Britain's hills and vales
    Extinct, or lingering in a happier clime,
    Where our abused inventions are unknown
    And benefits are weighed in Reason's scales?
