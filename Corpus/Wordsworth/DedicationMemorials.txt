  Dear Fellow-travellers!think not that the Muse,
    To You presenting these memorial Lays,
    Can hope the general eye thereon would gaze,
    As on a mirror that gives back the hues
    Of living Nature; no--though free to choose                    
    The greenest bowers, the most inviting ways,
    The fairest landscapes and the brightest days--
    Her skill she tried with less ambitious views.
    For You she wrought: Ye only can supply
    The life, the truth, the beauty: she confides                 
    In that enjoyment which with You abides,
    Trusts to your love and vivid memory;
    Thus far contented, that for You her verse
    Shall lack not power the "meeting soul to pierce!"
