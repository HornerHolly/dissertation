  Is _Death_, when evil against good has fought
    With such fell mastery that a man may dare
    By deeds the blackest purpose to lay bare?
    Is Death, for one to that condition brought,
    For him, or any one, the thing that ought                          
    To be _most_ dreaded? Lawgivers, beware,
    Lest, capital pains remitting till ye spare
    The murderer, ye, by sanction to that thought
    Seemingly given, debase the general mind;
    Tempt the vague will tried standards to disown,                   
    Nor only palpable restraints unbind,
    But upon Honourâ€™s head disturb the crown,
    Whose absolute rule permits not to withstand
    In the weak love of life his least command.
