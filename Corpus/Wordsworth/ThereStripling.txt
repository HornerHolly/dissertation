 "There!" said a Stripling, pointing with meet pride
    Towards a low roof with green trees half concealed,
    "Is Mosgiel Farm; and that's the very field
    Where Burns ploughed up the Daisy." Far and wide
    A plain below stretched seaward, while, descried                   
    Above sea-clouds, the Peaks of Arran rose;
    And, by that simple notice, the repose
    Of earth, sky, sea, and air, was vivified.
    Beneath "the random _bield_ of clod or stone"
    Myriads of daisies have shone forth in flower                     
    Near the lark's nest, and in their natural hour
    Have passed away; less happy than the One
    That, by the unwilling ploughshare, died to prove
    The tender charm of poetry and love.
