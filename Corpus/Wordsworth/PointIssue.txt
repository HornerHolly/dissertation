 For what contend the wise?--for nothing less
    Than that the Soul, freed from the bonds of Sense,
    And to her God restored by evidence
    Of things not seen, drawn forth from their recess,
    Root there, and not in forms, her holiness;--                      
    For Faith, which to the Patriarchs did dispense
    Sure guidance, ere a ceremonial fence
    Was needful round men thirsting to transgress;--
    For Faith, more perfect still, with which the Lord
    Of all, himself a Spirit, in the youth                            
    Of Christian aspiration, deigned to fill
    The temples of their hearts who, with his word
    Informed, were resolute to do his will,
    And worship him in spirit and in truth.
