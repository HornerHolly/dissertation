Failing impartial measure to dispense
    To every suitor, Equity is lame
    And social Justice, stript of reverence
    For natural rights, a mockery and a shame;
    Law but a servile dupe of false pretence,                          
    If, guarding grossest things from common claim
    Now and for ever, She, to works that came
    From mind and spirit, grudge a short-lived fence.
    What lengthened privilege, a lineal tie,
    For Books Yes, heartless Ones, or be it proved                
    That tis a fault in Us to have lived and loved
    Like others, with like temporal hopes to die;
    No public harm that Genius from her course
    Be turned; and streams of truth dried up, even at their source
