 Motions and Means, on land and sea at war
    With old poetic feeling, not for this,
    Shall ye, by Poets even, be judged amiss!
    Nor shall your presence, howsoe'er it mar
    The loveliness of Nature, prove a bar                              
    To the Mind's gaining that prophetic sense
    Of future change, that point of vision, whence
    May be discovered what in soul ye are.
    In spite of all that beauty may disown
    In your harsh features, Nature doth embrace                       
    Her lawful offspring in Man's art; and Time,
    Pleased with your triumphs o'er his brother Space,
    Accepts from your bold hands the proffered crown
    Of hope, and smiles on you with cheer sublime.
