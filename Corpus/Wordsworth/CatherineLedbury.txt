 When human touch (as monkish books attest)
    Nor was applied nor could be, Ledbury bells
    Broke forth in concert flung adown the dells,
    And upward, high as Malvernâ€™s cloudy crest;
    Sweet tones, and caught by a noble Lady blest                      
    To rapture! Mabel listened at the side
    Of her loved mistress: soon the music died,
    And Catherine said, Here I set up my rest.
    Warned in a dream, the Wanderer long had sought
    A home that by such miracle of sound                              
    Must be revealed:--she heard it now, or felt
    The deep, deep joy of a confiding thought;
    And there, a saintly Anchoress, she dwelt
    Till she exchanged for heaven that happy ground.
