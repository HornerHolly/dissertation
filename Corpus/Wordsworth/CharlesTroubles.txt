 Even such the contrast that, where'er we move,
    To the mind's eye Religion doth present;
    Now with her own deep quietness content;
    Then, like the mountain, thundering from above
    Against the ancient pine-trees of the grove                        
    And the Land's humblest comforts. Now her mood
    Recals the transformation of the flood,
    Whose rage the gentle skies in vain reprove,
    Earth cannot check. O terrible excess
    Of headstrong will! Can this be Piety?                            
    No--some fierce Maniac hath usurped her name;
    And scourges England struggling to be free:
    Her peace destroyed! her hopes a wilderness!
    Her blessings cursed--her glory turned to shame!
