 Go, faithful Portrait! and where long hath knelt
    Margaret, the saintly Foundress, take thy place;
    And, if Time spare the colours for the grace
    Which to the work surpassing skill hath dealt,
    Thou, on thy rock reclined, though kingdoms melt                   
    And states be torn up by the roots, wilt seem
    To breathe in rural peace, to hear the stream,
    And think and feel as once the Poet felt.
    Whate'er thy fate, those features have not grown
    Unrecognised through many a household tear
    More prompt, more glad, to fall than drops of dew
    By morning shed around a flower half-blown;
    Tears of delight, that testified how true
    To life thou art, and, in thy truth, how dear!
