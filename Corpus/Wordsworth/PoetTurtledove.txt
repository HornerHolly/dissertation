 As often as I murmur here
      My half-formed melodies,
    Straight from her osier mansion near,
      The Turtledove replies:
    Though silent as a leaf before,                                    
      The captive promptly coos;
    Is it to teach her own soft lore,
      Or second my weak Muse?

    I rather think, the gentle Dove
      Is murmuring a reproof,                                         
    Displeased that I from lays of love
      Have dared to keep aloof;
    That I, a Bard of hill and dale,
      Have carolled, fancy free,
    As if nor dove nor nightingale,                                   
      Had heart or voice for me.

    If such thy meaning, O forbear,
      Sweet Bird! to do me wrong;
    Love, blessed Love, is every where
      The spirit of my song:                                          
    'Mid grove, and by the calm fireside,
      Love animates my lyre--
    That coo again!--'tis not to chide,
      I feel, but to inspire.
