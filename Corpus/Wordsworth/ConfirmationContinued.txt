I saw a Mother's eye intensely bent
    Upon a Maiden trembling as she knelt;
    In and for whom the pious Mother felt
    Things that we judge of by a light too faint:
    Tell, if ye may, some star-crowned Muse, or Saint!                 
    Tell what rushed in, from what she was relieved--
    Then, when her Child the hallowing touch received,
    And such vibration through the Mother went
    That tears burst forth amain. Did gleams appear?
    Opened a vision of that blissful place                            
    Where dwells a Sister-child? And was power given
    Part of her lost One's glory back to trace
    Even to this Rite? For thus _She_ knelt, and, ere
    The summer-leaf had faded, passed to Heaven.
