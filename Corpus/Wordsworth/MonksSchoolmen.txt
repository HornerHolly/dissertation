 Record we too, with just and faithful pen,
    That many hooded Cenobites there are,
    Who in their private cells have yet a care
    Of public quiet; unambitious Men,
    Counsellors for the world, of piercing ken;                        
    Whose fervent exhortations from afar
    Move Princes to their duty, peace or war;
    And oft-times in the most forbidding den
    Of solitude, with love of science strong,
    How patiently the yoke of thought they bear!                      
    How subtly glide its finest threads along!
    Spirits that crowd the intellectual sphere
    With mazy boundaries, as the astronomer
    With orb and cycle girds the starry throng.
