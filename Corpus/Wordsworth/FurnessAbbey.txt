 Here, where, of havoc tired and rash undoing,
    Man left this Structure to become Time’s prey
    A soothing spirit follows in the way
    That Nature takes, her counter-work pursuing.
    See how her Ivy clasps the sacred Ruin
    Fall to prevent or beautify decay;
    And, on the mouldered walls, how bright, how gay,
    The flowers in pearly dews their bloom renewing!
    Thanks to the place, blessings upon the hour;
    Even as I speak the rising Sun’s first smile                      
    Gleams on the grass-crowned top of yon tall Tower
    Whose cawing occupants with joy proclaim
    Prescriptive title to the shattered pile
    Where, Cavendish, thine_ seems nothing but a name!
