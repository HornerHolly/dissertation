I, who accompanied with faithful pace
    Cerulean Duddon from its cloud-fed spring,
    And loved with spirit ruled by his to sing
    Of mountain-quiet and boon nature's grace;
    I, who essayed the nobler Stream to trace                         
    Of Liberty,and smote the plausive string
    Till the checked torrent, proudly triumphing,
    Won for herself a lasting resting-place;
    Now seek upon the heights of Time the source
    Of a HOLY RIVER,on whose banks are found                      
    Sweet pastoral flowers, and laurels that have crowned
    Full oft the unworthy brow of lawless force;
    And, for delight of him who tracks its course,
    Immortal amaranth and palms abound.
