 O gentle sleep! do they belong to thee,
    These twinklings of oblivion? Thou dost love
    To sit in meekness, like the brooding Dove,
    A captive never wishing to be free.
    This tiresome night, O Sleep! thou art to me                 
    A Fly, that up and down himself doth shove
    Upon a fretful rivulet, now above
    Now on the water vexed with mockery.
    I have no pain that calls for patience, no;
    Hence am I cross and peevish as a child:                 
    Am pleased by fits to have thee for my foe,
    Yet ever willing to be reconciled:
    O gentle Creature! do not use me so,
    But once and deeply let me be beguiled.
