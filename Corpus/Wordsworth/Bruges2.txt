  The Spirit of Antiquity enshrined
    In sumptuous buildings, vocal in sweet song,
    In picture, speaking with heroic tongue,
    And with devout solemnities entwined
    Mounts to the seat of grace within the mind          
    Hence Forms that glide with swan-like ease along,
    Hence motions, even amid the vulgar throng,
    To an harmonious decency confined
    As if the streets were consecrated ground,
    The city one vast temple, dedicate                            
    To mutual respect in thought and deed;
    To leisure, to forbearances sedate
    To social cares from jarring passions freed
    A deeper peace than that in deserts found
