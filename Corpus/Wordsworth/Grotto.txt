  O moon! if e’er I joyed when thy soft light
      Danc’d to the murmuring rill on Lomond’s wave,
    Or sighed for thy sweet presence some dark night
      When thou wert hidden in thy monthly grave,
    If e’er on wings which active fancy gave                           
      I sought thy golden vale with dancing flight
    Then stretcht at ease in some sequestered cave
      Gaz’d on thy lovely Nymphs with fond delight,
    Thy Nymphs with more than earthly beauty bright,
    If e’er thy beam, as Smyrna’s shepherds tell,                     
      Soft as the gentle kiss of amorous maid
    On the closed eye of young Endymion fell
      That he might wake to clasp thee in the shade,
    Each night while I recline within this cell
    Guide hither, O sweet Moon, the maid I love so well.
