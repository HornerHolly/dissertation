  Ranging the heights of Scawfell or Black-Comb,
    In his lone course the Shepherd oft will pause,
    And strive to fathom the mysterious laws
    By which the clouds, arrayed in light or gloom,
    On Mona settle, and the shapes assume                              
    Of all her peaks and ridges.What he draws
    From sense, faith, reason, fancy, of the cause,
    He will take with him to the silent tomb.
    Or, by his fire, a child upon his knee,
    Haply the untaught Philosopher may speak                          
    Of the strange sight, nor hide his theory
    That satisfies the simple and the meek,
    Blest in their pious ignorance, though weak
    To cope with Sages undevoutly free.
