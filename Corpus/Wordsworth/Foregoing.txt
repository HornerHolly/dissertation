 Where are they now, those wanton Boys?
  For whose free range the d√¶dal earth
  Was filled with animated toys,
  And implements of frolic mirth;
  With tools for ready wit to guide;                            
  And ornaments of seemlier pride,
  More fresh, more bright, than princes wear;
  For what one moment flung aside,
  Another could repair;
  What good or evil have they seen                             
  Since I their pastime witnessed here,
  Their daring wiles, their sportive cheer?
  I ask--but all is dark between!
  

  They met me in a genial hour,
  When universal nature breathed                               
  As with the breath of one sweet flower,--
  A time to overrule the power
  Of discontent, and check the birth
  Of thoughts with better thoughts at strife,
  The most familiar bane of life                               
  Since parting Innocence bequeathed
  Mortality to Earth!
  Soft clouds, the whitest of the year,
  Sailed through the sky--the brooks ran clear;
  The lambs from rock to rock were bounding;                   
  With songs the budded groves resounding;
  And to my heart are still endeared
  The thoughts with which it then was cheered; 
  The faith which saw that gladsome pair
  Walk through the fire with unsinged hair.                    
  Or, if such faith must needs deceive--
  Then, Spirits of beauty and of grace, 
  Associates in that eager chase;
  Ye, who within the blameless mind
  Your favourite seat of empire find--
  Kind Spirits! may we not believe
  That they, so happy and so fair
  Through your sweet influence, and the care
  Of pitying Heaven, at least were free
  From touch of _deadly_ injury?                               
  Destined, whate'er their earthly doom,
  For mercy and immortal bloom?
