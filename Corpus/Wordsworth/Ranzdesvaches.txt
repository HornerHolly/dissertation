   I listen--but no faculty of mine
    Avails those modulations to detect,
    Which, heard in foreign lands, the Swiss affect
    With tenderest passion; leaving him to pine
    (So fame reports) and die,--his sweet-breath'd kine
    Remembering, and green Alpine pastures decked                 
    With vernal flowers. Yet may we not reject
    The tale as fabulous.--Here while I recline,
    Mindful how others by this simple Strain
    Are moved, for me--upon this Mountain named
    Of God himself from dread pre-eminence--
    Aspiring thoughts, by memory reclaimed,
    Yield to the Music's touching influence;
    And joys of distant home my heart enchain.
