 Haydon! let worthier judges praise the skill
    Here by thy pencil shown in truth of lines
    And charm of colours; _I_ applaud those signs
    Of thought, that give the true poetic thrill;
    That unencumbered whole of blank and still,                        
    Sky without cloudocean without a wave;
    And the one Man that laboured to enslave
    The World, sole standing high on the bare hill--
    Back turned, arms folded, the unapparent face
    Tinged, we may fancy, in this dreary place                        
    With light reflected from the invisible sun
    Set, like his fortunes; but not set for aye
    Like them. The unguilty Power pursues his way,
    And before _him_ doth dawn perpetual run.
