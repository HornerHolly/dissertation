 "What beast in wilderness or cultured field
    "The lively beauty of the leopard shows?
    "What flower in meadow-ground or garden grows
    "That to the towering lily doth not yield?
    "Let both meet only on thy royal shield!                           
    "Go forth, great King! claim what thy birth bestows;
    "Conquer the Gallic lily which thy foes
    "Dare to usurp thou hast a sword to wield,
    "And Heaven will crown the right. The mitred Sire
    Thus spake and lo! a Fleet, for Gaul addrest,                    
    Ploughs her bold course across the wondering seas;
    For, sooth to say, ambition, in the breast
    Of youthful heroes, is no sullen fire,
    But one that leaps to meet the fanning breeze.
