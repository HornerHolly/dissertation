  List twas the Cuckoo O with what delight
    Heard I that voice! and catch it now, though faint,
    Far off and faint, and melting into air,
    Yet not to be mistaken. Hark again!
    Those louder cries give notice that the Bird,                      
    Although invisible as Echoes self,
    Is wheeling hitherward. Thanks, happy Creature,
    For this unthought of greeting!
                                      While allured
    From vale to hill, from hill to vale led on,
    We have pursued, through various lands, a long                    
    And pleasant course; flower after flower has blown,
    Embellishing the ground that gave them birth
    With aspects novel to my sight; but still
    Most fair, most welcome, when they drank the dew
    In a sweet fellowship with kinds beloved,                         
    For old remembrance sake. And oft--where Spring
    Displayd her richest blossoms among files
    Of orange-trees bedecked with glowing fruit
    Ripe for the hand, or under a thick shade
    Of Ilex, or, if better suited to the hour,                        
    The lightsome Olives twinkling canopy
    Oft have I heard the Nightingale and Thrush
    Blending as in a common English grove
    Their love-songs; but, wherever my feet might roam,
    Whatever assemblages of new and old,                              
    Strange and familiar, might beguile the way,
    A gratulation from that vagrant Voice
    Was wanting and most happily till now.

    For see, Laverna! mark the far-famed Pile,
    High on the brink of that precipitous rock,
    Implanted like a Fortress, as in truth
    It is, a Christian Fortress, garrisoned
    In faith and hope, and dutiful obedience,
    By a few Monks, a stern society,
    Dead to the world and scorning earth-born joys.                   
    Nay--though the hopes that drew, the fears that drove,
    St. Francis, far from Man resort, to abide
    Among these sterile heights of Apennine, 
    Bound him, nor, since he raised yon House, have ceased
    To bind his spiritual Progeny, with rules                         
    Stringent as flesh can tolerate and live;
    His milder Genius (thanks to the good God
    That made us) over those severe restraints
    Of mind, that dread heart-freezing discipline,
    Doth sometimes here predominate, and works                        
    By unsought means for gracious purposes;
    For earth through heaven, for heaven, by changeful earth,
    Illustrated, and mutually endeared.

      Rapt though He were above the power of sense,
    Familiarly, yet out of the cleansed heart                         
    Of that once sinful Being overflowed
    On sun, moon, stars, the nether elements,
    And every shape of creature they sustain,
    Divine affections; and with beast and bird
    (Stilled from afar such marvel story tells--                     
    By casual outbreak of his passionate words,
    And from their own pursuits in field or grove
    Drawn to his side by look or act of love
    Humane, and virtue of his innocent life)
    He wont to hold companionship so free,                            
    So pure, so fraught with knowledge and delight,
    As to be likened in his Followers minds
    To that which our first Parents, ere the fall
    From their high state darkened the Earth with fear,
    Held with all Kinds in Eden blissful bowers.                    

      Then question not that, mid the austere Band,
    Who breathe the air he breathed, tread where he trod,
    Some true Partakers of his loving spirit
    Do still survive, and, with those gentle hearts
    Consorted, Others, in the power, the faith,                       
    Of a baptized imagination, prompt
    To catch from Nature humblest monitors
    Whateâ€™er they bring of impulses sublime.

      Thus sensitive must be the Monk, though pale
    With fasts, with vigils worn, depressed by years,                 
    Whom in a sunny glade I chanced to see,
    Upon a pine-trees storm-uprooted trunk,
    Seated alone, with forehead sky-ward raised,
    Hands clasped above the crucifix he wore
    Appended to his bosom, and lips closed                            
    By the joint pressure of his musing mood
    And habit of his vow. That ancient Man
    Nor haply less the Brother whom I marked,
    As we approached the Convent gate, aloft
    Looking far forth from his aerial cell,                           
    A young Ascetic Poet, Hero, Sage,
    He might have been, Lover belike he was--
    If they received into a conscious ear
    The notes whose first faint greeting startled me,
    Whose sedulous iteration thrilled with joy                        
    My heart--may have been moved like me to think,
    Ah! not like me who walk in the worlds ways,
    On the great Prophet, styled _the Voice of One_
    _Crying amid the wilderness_, and given,
    Now that their snows must melt, their herbs and flowers           
    Revive, their obstinate winter pass away,
    That awful name to Thee, thee, simple Cuckoo,
    Wandering in solitude, and evermore
    Foretelling and proclaiming, ere thou leave
    This thy last haunt beneath Italian skies                        
    To carry thy glad tidings over heights
    Still loftier, and to climes more near the Pole.

      Voice of the Desert, fare-thee-well; sweet Bird!
    If that substantial title please thee more,
    Farewell but go thy way, no need hast thou                     
    Of a good wish sent after thee; from bower
    To bower as green, from sky to sky as clear,
    Thee gentle breezes waft--or airs that meet
    Thy course and sport around thee softly fan--
    Till Night, descending upon hill and vale,                       
    Grants to thy mission a brief term of silence,
    And folds thy pinions up in blest repose.
