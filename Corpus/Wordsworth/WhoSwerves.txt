  Who swerves from innocence, who makes divorce
    Of that serene companion a good name,
    Recovers not his loss; but walks with shame,
    With doubt, with fear, and haply with remorse:
    And oft times he who, yielding to the force                   
    Of chance temptation, ere his journey end,
    From chosen comrade turns, or faithful friend
    In vain shall rue the broken intercourse.
    Not so with such as loosely wear the chain
    That binds them, pleasant River! to thy side:              
    Through the rough copse wheel thou with hasty stride;
    I choose to saunter oer the grassy plain,
    Sure, when the separation has been tried,
    That we, who part in love, shall meet again.
