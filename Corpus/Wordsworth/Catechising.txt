From Little down to Least, in due degree,
    Around the Pastor, each in new-wrought vest,
    Each with a vernal posy at his breast,
    We stood, a trembling, earnest Company!
    With low soft murmur, like a distant bee,                          
    Some spake, by thought-perplexing fears betrayed;
    And some a bold unerring answer made:
    How fluttered then thy anxious heart for me,
    Belov√®d Mother! Thou whose happy hand
    Had bound the flowers I wore, with faithful tie:
    Sweet flowers! at whose inaudible command
    Her countenance, phantom-like, doth re-appear:
    O lost too early for the frequent tear,
    And ill requited by this heartfelt sigh!
