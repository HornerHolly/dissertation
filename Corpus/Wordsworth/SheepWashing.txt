 Sad thoughts, avaunt!--partake we their blithe cheer
    Who gathered in betimes the unshorn flock
    To wash the fleece, where haply bands of rock,
    Checking the stream, make a pool smooth and clear
    As this we look on. Distant Mountains hear,
    Hear and repeat, the turmoil that unites
    Clamour of boys with innocent despites
    Of barking dogs, and bleatings from strange fear.
    And what if Duddon's spotless flood receive
    Unwelcome mixtures as the uncouth noise                       
    Thickens, the pastoral River will forgive
    Such wrong; nor need _we_ blame the licensed joys,
    Though false to Nature's quiet equipoise:
    Frank are the sports, the stains are fugitive.
