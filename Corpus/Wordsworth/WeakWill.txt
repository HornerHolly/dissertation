    "Weak is the will of Man, his judgment blind;
    Remembrance persecutes, and Hope betrays;
    Heavy is woe; and joy, for human-kind,
    A mournful thing, so transient is the blaze!"
    Thus might he paint our lot of mortal days                   
    Who wants the glorious faculty assigned
    To elevate the more than reasoning Mind,
    And colour lifes dark cloud with orient rays.
    Imagination is that sacred power,
    Imagination lofty and refined:                                
    Tis hers to pluck the amaranthine flower
    Of Faith, and round the Sufferers temples bind
    Wreaths that endure afflictions heaviest shower,
    And do not shrink from sorrows keenest wind.
