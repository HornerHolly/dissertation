 Wanderer! that stoopst so low, and comst so near
    To human life unsettled atmosphere;
    Who lovst with Night and Silence to partake,
    So might it seem, the cares of them that wake;
    And, through the cottage lattice softly peeping,                   
    Dost shield from harm the humblest of the sleeping;
    What pleasure once encompassed those sweet names
    Which yet in thy behalf the Poet claims,
    An idolizing dreamer as of yore
    I slight them all; and, on this sea-beat shore                    
    Sole sitting, only can to thoughts attend
    That bid me hail thee as the SAILOR FRIEND;
    So call thee for heaven grace through thee made known
    By confidence supplied and mercy shown,
    When not a twinkling star or beacon light                       
    Abates the perils of a stormy night;
    And for less obvious benefits, that find
    Their way, with thy pure help, to heart and mind;
    Both for the adventurer starting in life prime;
    And veteran ranging round from clime to clime,                    
    Long baffled hope slow fever in his veins,
    And wounds and weakness oft his labour sole remains.

      The aspiring Mountains and the winding Streams,
    Empress of Night are gladdened by thy beams;
    A look of thine the wilderness pervades,                         
    And penetrates the forest inmost shades;
    Thou, chequering peaceably the minster gloom,
    Guidst the pale Mourner to the lost oneâ€™s tomb;
    Canst reach the Prisoner to his grated cell
    Welcome though silent and intangible                         
    And lives there one, of all that come and go
    On the great waters toiling to and fro,
    One, who has watched thee at some quiet hour
    Enthroned aloft in undisputed power,
    Or crossed by vapoury streaks and clouds that move                
    Catching the lustre they in part reprove
    Nor sometimes felt a fitness in thy sway
    To call up thoughts that shun the glare of day,
    And make the serious happier than the gay

      Yes, lovely Moon if thou so mildly bright                      
    Dost rouse, yet surely in thy own despite,
    To fiercer mood the phrenzy stricken brain,
    Let me a compensating faith maintain;
    That there a sensitive, a tender, part
    Which thou canst touch in every human heart,                      
    For healing and composure But as least
    And mightiest billows ever have confessed
    Thy domination as the whole vast Sea
    Feels through her lowest depths thy sovereignty;
    So shines that countenance with especial grace                    
    On them who urge the keel her plains to trace
    Furrowing its way right onward. The most rude,
    Cut off from home and country, may have stood
    Even till long gazing hath bedimmed his eye,
    Or the mute rapture ended in a sigh                            
    Touched by accordance of thy placid cheer,
    With some internal lights to memory dear,
    Or fancies stealing forth to soothe the breast
    Tired with its daily share of earth unrest
    Gentle awakenings, visitations meek;                              
    A kindly influence whereof few will speak,
    Though it can wet with tears the hardiest cheek.

      And when thy beauty in the shadowy cave
    Is hidden, buried in its monthly grave;
    Then, while the Sailor, mid an open sea                          
    Swept by a favouring wind that leaves thought free,
    Paces the deck no star perhaps in sight,
    And nothing save the moving ship own light
    To cheer the long dark hours of vacant night
    Oft with his musings does thy image blend,                        
    In his mind eye thy crescent horns ascend,
    And thou art still, O Moon, that SAILOR FRIEND!
