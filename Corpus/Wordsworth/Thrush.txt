Hark! tis the Thrush, undaunted, undeprest,
    By twilight premature of cloud and rain;
    Nor does that roaring wind deaden his strain
    Who carols thinking of his Love and nest,
    And seems, as more incited, still more blest.                      
    Thanks; thou hast snapped a fireside Prisoner chain,
    Exulting Warbler! eased a fretted brain,
    And in a moment charmed my cares to rest.
    Yes, I will forth, bold Bird! and front the blast,
    That we may sing together, if thou wilt,                          
    So loud, so clear, my Partner through life day,
    Mute in her nest lovechosen, if not lovebuilt
    Like thine, shall gladden, as in seasons past,
    Thrilled by loose snatches of the social Lay.
