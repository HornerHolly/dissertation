 Ere with cold beads of midnight dew
      Had mingled tears of thine,
    I grieved, fond Youth! that thou shouldst sue
      To haughty Geraldine.

    Immoveable by generous sighs,                                      
      She glories in a train
    Who drag, beneath our native skies,
      An oriental chain.

    Pine not like them with arms across,
      Forgetting in thy care                                          
    How the fast-rooted trees can toss
      Their branches in mid air.

    The humblest rivulet will take
      Its own wild liberties;
    And, every day, the imprisoned lake                               
      Is flowing in the breeze.

    Then, crouch no more on suppliant knee,
      But scorn with scorn outbrave;
    A Briton, even in love, should be
      A subject, not a slave!
