Eden! till now thy beauty had I viewed
    By glimpses only, and confess with shame
    That verse of mine, whate'er its varying mood,
    Repeats but once the sound of thy sweet name:
    Yet fetched from Paradise that honour came,                  
    Rightfully borne; for Nature gives thee flowers
    That have no rivals among British bowers;
    And thy bold rocks are worthy of their fame.
    Measuring thy course, fair Stream! at length I pay
    To my life's neighbour dues of neighbourhood;                     
    But I have traced thee on thy winding way
    With pleasure sometimes by this thought restrained
    For things far off we toil, while many a good
    Not sought, because too near, is never gained.
