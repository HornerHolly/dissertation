There is an Eminence,--of these our hills
  The last that parleys with the setting sun;
  We can behold it from our orchard-seat;
  And, when at evening we pursue our walk
  Along the public way, this Peak, so high                
  Above us, and so distant in its height,
  Is visible; and often seems to send
  Its own deep quiet to restore our hearts.
  The meteors make of it a favourite haunt:
  The star of Jove, so beautiful and large                    
  In the mid heavens, is never half so fair
  As when he shines above it. 'Tis in truth
  The loneliest place we have among the clouds.
  And She who dwells with me, whom I have loved
  With such communion, that no place on earth                 
  Can ever be a solitude to me,
  Hath to this lonely Summit given my Name.
