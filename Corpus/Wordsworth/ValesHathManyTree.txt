In these fair vales hath many a Tree
      At Wordsworth's suit been spared;
    And from the builder's hand this Stone,
    For some rude beauty of its own,
      Was rescued by the Bard:                                         
    So let it rest; and time will come
    When here the tender-hearted
    May heave a gentle sigh for him,
      As one of the departed.
