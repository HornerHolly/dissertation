  The linnet's warble, sinking towards a close,
    Hints to the thrush 'tis time for their repose;
    The shrill-voiced thrush is heedless, and again
    The monitor revives his own sweet strain;
    But both will soon be mastered, and the copse                      
    Be left as silent as the mountain-tops,
    Ere some commanding star dismiss to rest
    The throng of rooks, that now, from twig or nest,
    (After a steady flight on home-bound wings,
    And a last game of mazy hoverings                                 
    Around their ancient grove) with cawing noise
    Disturb the liquid music's equipoise.

      O Nightingale! Who ever heard thy song
    Might here be moved, till Fancy grows so strong
    That listening sense is pardonably cheated                        
    Where wood or stream by thee was never greeted.
    Surely, from fairest spots of favoured lands,
    Were not some gifts withheld by jealous hands,
    This hour of deepening darkness here would be
    As a fresh morning for new harmony;                              
    And lays as prompt would hail the dawn of Night:
    A _dawn_ she has both beautiful and bright,
    When the East kindles with the full moon's light;
    Not like the rising sun's impatient glow
    Dazzling the mountains, but an overflow                           
    Of solemn splendour, in mutation slow.

      Wanderer by spring with gradual progress led,
    For sway profoundly felt as widely spread;
    To king, to peasant, to rough sailor, dear,
    And to the soldier's trumpet-wearied ear;                         
    How welcome wouldst thou be to this green Vale
    Fairer than Tempe! Yet, sweet Nightingale!
    From the warm breeze that bears thee on, alight
    At will, and stay thy migratory flight;
    Build, at thy choice, or sing, by pool or fount,                  
    Who shall complain, or call thee to account?
    The wisest, happiest, of our kind are they
    That ever walk content with Nature's way,
    God's goodness--measuring bounty as it may;
    For whom the gravest thought of what they miss,                   
    Chastening the fulness of a present bliss,
    Is with that wholesome office satisfied,
    While unrepining sadness is allied
    In thankful bosoms to a modest pride.
