  Harp! could'st thou venture, on thy boldest string,
    The faintest note to echo which the blast
    Caught from the hand of Moses as it pass'd
    O'er Sinai's top, or from the Shepherd-king,
    Early awake, by Siloa's brook, to sing                             
    Of dread Jehovah; then, should wood and waste
    Hear also of that name, and mercy cast
    Off to the mountains, like a covering
    Of which the Lord was weary. Weep, oh! weep,
    Weep with the good, beholding King and Priest                
    Despised by that stern God to whom they raise
    Their suppliant hands; but holy is the feast
    He keepeth; like the firmament his ways:
    His statutes like the chambers of the deep.
