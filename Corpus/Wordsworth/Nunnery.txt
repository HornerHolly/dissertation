The floods are roused, and will not soon be weary;
    Down from the Pennine Alps how fiercely sweeps
    Croglin, the stately Eden's tributary!
    He raves, or through some moody passage creeps
    Plotting new mischief--out again he leaps                          
    Into broad light, and sends, through regions airy,
    That voice which soothed the Nuns while on the steeps
    They knelt in prayer, or sang to blissful Mary.
    That union ceased: then, cleaving easy walks
    Through crags, and smoothing paths beset with danger,
    Came studious Taste; and many a pensive stranger                  
    Dreams on the banks, and to the river talks.
    What change shall happen next to Nunnery Dell?
    Canal, and Viaduct, and Railway, tell!
