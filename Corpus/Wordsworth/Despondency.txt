A HUMMING BEE--a little tinkling rill--
    A pair of falcons wheeling on the wing,
    In clamorous agitation, round the crest
    Of a tall rock, their airy citadel--
    By each and all of these the pensive ear                      
    Was greeted, in the silence that ensued,
    When through the cottage threshold we had passed,
    And, deep within that lonesome valley, stood
    Once more beneath the concave of a blue
    And cloudless sky.--Anon exclaimed our Host,                  
    Triumphantly dispersing with the taunt
    The shade of discontent which on his brow
    Had gathered,--"Ye have left my cell,--but see
    How Nature hems you in with friendly arms!
    And by her help ye are my prisoners still.                    
    But which way shall I lead you?--how contrive,
    In spot so parsimoniously endowed,
    That the brief hours, which yet remain, may reap
    Some recompense of knowledge or delight?"
    So saying, round he looked, as if perplexed;                  
    And, to remove those doubts, my grey-haired Friend
    Said--"Shall we take this pathway for our guide?--
    Upward it winds, as if, in summer heats,
    Its line had first been fashioned by the flock
    Seeking a place of refuge at the root                    
    Of yon black Yew-tree, whose protruded boughs
    Darken the silver bosom of the crag,
    From which she draws her meagre sustenance.
    There in commodious shelter may we rest.
    Or let us trace this streamlet to its source;            
    Feebly it tinkles with an earthy sound,
    And a few steps may bring us to the spot
    Where, haply, crowned with flowerets and green herbs,
    The mountain infant to the sun comes forth,
    Like human life from darkness."--A quick turn
    Through a strait passage of encumbered ground,
    Proved that such hope was vain:--for now we stood
    Shut out from prospect of the open vale,
    And saw the water, that composed this rill,
    Descending, disembodied, and diffused                         
    O'er the smooth surface of an ample crag,
    Lofty, and steep, and naked as a tower.
    All further progress here was barred;--And who,
    Thought I, if master of a vacant hour,
    Here would not linger, willingly detained?                    
    Whether to such wild objects he were led
    When copious rains have magnified the stream
    Into a loud and white-robed waterfall,
    Or introduced at this more quiet time.

      Upon a semicirque of turf-clad ground,                      
    The hidden nook discovered to our view
    A mass of rock, resembling, as it lay
    Right at the foot of that moist precipice,
    A stranded ship, with keel upturned, that rests
    Fearless of winds and waves. Three several stones             
    Stood near, of smaller size, and not unlike
    To monumental pillars: and, from these
    Some little space disjoined, a pair were seen,
    That with united shoulders bore aloft
    A fragment, like an altar, flat and smooth:                  
    Barren the tablet, yet thereon appeared
    A tall and shining holly, that had found
    A hospitable chink, and stood upright,
    As if inserted by some human hand
    In mockery, to wither in the sun,                             
    Or lay its beauty flat before a breeze,
    The first that entered. But no breeze did now
    Find entrance;--high or low appeared no trace
    Of motion, save the water that descended,
    Diffused adown that barrier of steep rock,                   
    And softly creeping, like a breath of air,
    Such as is sometimes seen, and hardly seen,
    To brush the still breast of a crystal lake.

      "Behold a cabinet for sages built,
    Which kings might envy!"--Praise to this effect              
    Broke from the happy old Man's reverend lip;
    Who to the Solitary turned, and said,
    "In sooth, with love's familiar privilege,
    You have decried the wealth which is your own.
    Among these rocks and stones, methinks, I see                 
    More than the heedless impress that belongs
    To lonely nature's casual work: they bear
    A semblance strange of power intelligent,
    And of design not wholly worn away.
    Boldest of plants that ever faced the wind,                   
    How gracefully that slender shrub looks forth
    From its fantastic birth-place! And I own,
    Some shadowy intimations haunt me here,
    That in these shows a chronicle survives
    Of purposes akin to those of Man,
    But wrought with mightier arm than now prevails.
    --Voiceless the stream descends into the gulf
    With timid lapse;--and lo! while in this strait
    I stand--the chasm of sky above my head
    Is heaven's profoundest azure; no domain                     
    For fickle, short-lived clouds to occupy,
    Or to pass through; but rather an abyss
    In which the everlasting stars abide;
    And whose soft gloom, and boundless depth, might tempt
    The curious eye to look for them by day.
    --Hail Contemplation! from the stately towers,
    Reared by the industrious hand of human art
    To lift thee high above the misty air
    And turbulence of murmuring cities vast;
    From academic groves, that have for thee                     
    Been planted, hither come and find a lodge
    To which thou mayst resort for holier peace,--
    From whose calm centre thou, through height or depth,
    Mayst penetrate, wherever truth shall lead;
    Measuring through all degrees, until the scale               
    Of time and conscious nature disappear,
    Lost in unsearchable eternity!"

      A pause ensued; and with minuter care
    We scanned the various features of the scene:
    And soon the Tenant of that lonely vale                      
    With courteous voice thus spake--
                                     "I should have grieved
    Hereafter, not escaping self-reproach,
    If from my poor retirement ye had gone
    Leaving this nook unvisited: but, in sooth,
    Your unexpected presence had so roused                       
    My spirits, that they were bent on enterprise;
    And, like an ardent hunter, I forgot,
    Or, shall I say?--disdained, the game that lurks
    At my own door. The shapes before our eyes,
    And their arrangement, doubtless must be deemed              
    The sport of Nature, aided by blind Chance
    Rudely to mock the works of toiling Man.
    And hence, this upright shaft of unhewn stone,
    From Fancy, willing to set off her stores
    By sounding titles, hath acquired the name                   
    Of Pompey's pillar; that I gravely style
    My Theban obelisk; and, there, behold
    A Druid cromlech!--thus I entertain
    The antiquarian humour, and am pleased
    To skim along the surfaces of things,                        
    Beguiling harmlessly the listless hours.
    But if the spirit be oppressed by sense
    Of instability, revolt, decay,
    And change, and emptiness, these freaks of Nature
    And her blind helper Chance, do _then_ suffice               
    To quicken, and to aggravate--to feed
    Pity and scorn, and melancholy pride,
    Not less than that huge Pile (from some abyss
    Of mortal power unquestionably sprung)
    Whose hoary diadem of pendent rocks                          
    Confines the shrill-voiced whirlwind, round and round
    Eddying within its vast circumference,
    On Sarum's naked plain--than pyramid
    Of Egypt, unsubverted, undissolved--
    Or Syria's marble ruins towering high
    Above the sandy desert, in the light
    Of sun or moon.--Forgive me, if I say
    That an appearance which hath raised your minds
    To an exalted pitch (the self-same cause
    Different effect producing) is for me                        
    Fraught rather with depression than delight,
    Though shame it were, could I not look around,
    By the reflection of your pleasure, pleased.
    Yet happier, in my judgment, even than you
    With your bright transports, fairly may be deemed            
    The wandering Herbalist,--who, clear alike
    From vain, and, that worse evil, vexing thoughts,
    Casts, if he ever chance to enter here,
    Upon these uncouth Forms a slight regard
    Of transitory interest, and peeps round                      
    For some rare floweret of the hills, or plant
    Of craggy fountain; what he hopes for wins,
    Or learns, at least, that 'tis not to be won:
    Then, keen and eager, as a fine-nosed hound
    By soul-engrossing instinct driven along                     
    Through wood or open field, the harmless Man
    Departs, intent upon his onward quest!--
    Nor is that Fellow-wanderer, so deem I,
    Less to be envied, (you may trace him oft
    By scars which his activity has left                         
    Beside our roads and pathways, though, thank Heaven!
    This covert nook reports not of his hand)
    He who with pocket-hammer smites the edge
    Of luckless rock or prominent stone, disguised
    In weather-stains or crusted o'er by Nature                  
    With her first growths, detaching by the stroke
    A chip or splinter--to resolve his doubts;
    And, with that ready answer satisfied,
    The substance classes by some barbarous name,
    And hurries on; or from the fragments picks             
    His specimen, if but haply interveined
    With sparkling mineral, or should crystal cube
    Lurk in its cells--and thinks himself enriched,
    Wealthier, and doubtless wiser, than before!
    Intrusted safely each to his pursuit,                        
    Earnest alike, let both from hill to hill
    Range; if it please them, speed from clime to clime;
    The mind is full--and free from pain their pastime."

      "Then," said I, interposing, "One is near,
    Who cannot but possess in your esteem                        
    Place worthier still of envy. May I name,
    Without offence, that fair-faced cottage-boy?
    Dame Nature's pupil of the lowest form,
    Youngest apprentice in the school of art!
    Him, as we entered from the open glen,                       
    You might have noticed, busily engaged,
    Heart, soul, and hands,--in mending the defects
    Left in the fabric of a leaky dam
    Raised for enabling this penurious stream
    To turn a slender mill (that new-made plaything)             
    For his delight--the happiest he of all!"

      "Far happiest," answered the desponding Man,
    "If, such as now he is, he might remain!
    Ah! what avails imagination high
    Or question deep? what profits all that earth,               
    Or heaven's blue vault, is suffered to put forth
    Of impulse or allurement, for the Soul
    To quit the beaten track of life, and soar
    Far as she finds a yielding element
    In past or future; far as she can go                         
    Through time or space--if neither in the one,
    Nor in the other region, nor in aught
    That Fancy, dreaming o'er the map of things,
    Hath placed beyond these penetrable bounds,
    Words of assurance can be heard; if nowhere                  
    A habitation, for consummate good,
    Or for progressive virtue, by the search
    Can be attained,--a better sanctuary
    From doubt and sorrow, than the senseless grave?"

      "Is this," the grey-haired Wanderer mildly said,
    "The voice, which we so lately overheard,                    
    To that same child, addressing tenderly
    The consolations of a hopeful mind?
    '_His body is at rest, his soul in heaven._'
    These were your words; and, verily, methinks                 
    Wisdom is oft-times nearer when we stoop
    Than when we soar."--
                         The Other, not displeased,
    Promptly replied--"My notion is the same.
    And I, without reluctance, could decline
    All act of inquisition whence we rise,                       
    And what, when breath hath ceased, we may become.
    Here are we, in a bright and breathing world.
    Our origin, what matters it? In lack
    Of worthier explanation, say at once
    With the American (a thought which suits                     
    The place where now we stand) that certain men
    Leapt out together from a rocky cave;
    And these were the first parents of mankind:
    Or, if a different image be recalled
    By the warm sunshine, and the jocund voice                   
    Of insects chirping out their careless lives
    On these soft beds of thyme-besprinkled turf,
    Choose, with the gay Athenian, a conceit
    As sound--blithe race! whose mantles were bedecked
    With golden grasshoppers, in sign that they              
    Had sprung, like those bright creatures, from the soil
    Whereon their endless generations dwelt.
    But stop!--these theoretic fancies jar
    On serious minds: then, as the Hindoos draw
    Their holy Ganges from a skiey fount,                
    Even so deduce the stream of human life
    From seats of power divine; and hope, or trust,
    That our existence winds her stately course
    Beneath the sun, like Ganges, to make part
    Of a living ocean; or, to sink engulfed,
    Like Niger, in impenetrable sands
    And utter darkness: thought which may be faced,
    Though comfortless!--
                         "Not of myself I speak;
    Such acquiescence neither doth imply,
    In me, a meekly-bending spirit soothed                       
    By natural piety; nor a lofty mind,
    By philosophic discipline prepared
    For calm subjection to acknowledged law;
    Pleased to have been, contented not to be.
    Such palms I boast not;--no! to me, who find,                
    Reviewing my past way, much to condemn,
    Little to praise, and nothing to regret,
    (Save some remembrances of dream-like joys
    That scarcely seem to have belonged to me)
    If I must take my choice between the pair                    
    That rule alternately the weary hours,
    Night is than day more acceptable; sleep
    Doth, in my estimate of good, appear
    A better state than waking; death than sleep:
    Feelingly sweet is stillness after storm,                    
    Though under covert of the wormy ground!

      "Yet be it said, in justice to myself,
    That in more genial times, when I was free
    To explore the destiny of human kind
    (Not as an intellectual game pursued                         
    With curious subtilty, from wish to cheat
    Irksome sensations; but by love of truth
    Urged on, or haply by intense delight
    In feeding thought, wherever thought could feed)
    I did not rank with those (too dull or nice,                 
    For to my judgment such they then appeared,
    Or too aspiring, thankless at the best)
    Who, in this frame of human life, perceive
    An object whereunto their souls are tied
    In discontented wedlock; nor did e'er,                       
    From me, those dark impervious shades, that hang
    Upon the region whither we are bound,
    Exclude a power to enjoy the vital beams
    Of present sunshine.--Deities that float
    On wings, angelic Spirits! I could muse                      
    O'er what from eldest time we have been told
    Of your bright forms and glorious faculties,
    And with the imagination rest content,
    Not wishing more; repining not to tread
    The little sinuous path of earthly care,                     
    By flowers embellished, and by springs refreshed.
    --'Blow winds of autumn!--let your chilling breath
    Take the live herbage from the mead, and strip
    The shady forest of its green attire,--
    And let the bursting clouds to fury rouse                    
    The gentle brooks!--Your desolating sway,
    Sheds,' I exclaimed, 'no sadness upon me,
    And no disorder in your rage I find.
    What dignity, what beauty, in this change
    From mild to angry, and from sad to gay,                     
    Alternate and revolving! How benign,
    How rich in animation and delight,
    How bountiful these elements--compared
    With aught, as more desirable and fair,
    Devised by fancy for the golden age;                         
    Or the perpetual warbling that prevails
    In Arcady, beneath unaltered skies,
    Through the long year in constant quiet bound,
    Night hushed as night, and day serene as day!'
    --But why this tedious record?--Age, we know,                
    Is garrulous; and solitude is apt
    To anticipate the privilege of Age.
    From far ye come; and surely with a hope
    Of better entertainment:--let us hence!"

      Loth to forsake the spot, and still more loth              
    To be diverted from our present theme,
    I said, "My thoughts, agreeing, Sir, with yours,
    Would push this censure farther;--for, if smiles
    Of scornful pity be the just reward
    Of Poesy thus courteously employed                           
    In framing models to improve the scheme
    Of Man's existence, and recast the world,
    Why should not grave Philosophy be styled,
    Herself, a dreamer of a kindred stock,
    A dreamer yet more spiritless and dull?                      
    Yes, shall the fine immunities she boasts
    Establish sounder titles of esteem
    For her, who (all too timid and reserved
    For onset, for resistance too inert,
    Too weak for suffering, and for hope too tame)               
    Placed, among flowery gardens curtained round
    With world-excluding groves, the brotherhood
    Of soft Epicureans, taught--if they
    The ends of being would secure, and win
    The crown of wisdom--to yield up their souls                 
    To a voluptuous unconcern, preferring
    Tranquillity to all things. Or is she,"
    I cried, "more worthy of regard, the Power,
    Who, for the sake of sterner quiet, closed
    The Stoic's heart against the vain approach              
    Of admiration, and all sense of joy?"

      His countenance gave notice that my zeal
    Accorded little with his present mind;
    I ceased, and he resumed.--"Ah! gentle Sir,
    Slight, if you will, the _means_; but spare to slight        
    The _end_ of those, who did, by system, rank,
    As the prime object of a wise man's aim,
    Security from shock of accident,
    Release from fear; and cherished peaceful days
    For their own sakes, as mortal life's chief good,            
    And only reasonable felicity.
    What motive drew, what impulse, I would ask,
    Through a long course of later ages, drove
    The hermit to his cell in forest wide;
    Or what detained him, till his closing eyes                  
    Took their last farewell of the sun and stars,
    Fast anchored in the desert?--Not alone
    Dread of the persecuting sword, remorse,
    Wrongs unredressed, or insults unavenged
    And unavengeable, defeated pride,                            
    Prosperity subverted, maddening want,
    Friendship betrayed, affection unreturned,
    Love with despair, or grief in agony;--
    Not always from intolerable pangs                            
    He fled; but, compassed round by pleasure, sighed
    For independent happiness; craving peace,
    The central feeling of all happiness,
    Not as a refuge from distress or pain,
    A breathing-time, vacation, or a truce,
    But for its absolute self; a life of peace,                  
    Stability without regret or fear;
    That hath been, is, and shall be evermore!--
    Such the reward he sought; and wore out life,
    There, where on few external things his heart
    Was set, and those his own; or, if not his,                 
    Subsisting under nature's stedfast law.

      "What other yearning was the master tie
    Of the monastic brotherhood, upon rock
    Aërial, or in green secluded vale,
    One after one, collected from afar,                          
    An undissolving fellowship?--What but this,
    The universal instinct of repose,
    The longing for confirmed tranquillity,
    Inward and outward; humble, yet sublime:
    The life where hope and memory are as one;                  
    Where earth is quiet and her face unchanged
    Save by the simplest toil of human hands
    Or seasons' difference; the immortal Soul
    Consistent in self-rule; and heaven revealed
    To meditation in that quietness!--                           
    Such was their scheme: and though the wished for end
    By multitudes was missed, perhaps attained
    By none, they for the attempt, and pains employed,
    Do, in my present censure, stand redeemed
    From the unqualified disdain, that once                      
    Would have been cast upon them by my voice
    Delivering her decisions from the seat
    Of forward youth--that scruples not to solve
    Doubts, and determine questions, by the rules
    Of inexperienced judgment, ever prone                        
    To overweening faith; and is inflamed,
    By courage, to demand from real life
    The test of act and suffering, to provoke
    Hostility--how dreadful when it comes,
    Whether affliction be the foe, or guilt!                     

      "A child of earth, I rested, in that stage
    Of my past course to which these thoughts advert,
    Upon earth's native energies; forgetting
    That mine was a condition which required
    Nor energy, nor fortitude--a calm                            
    Without vicissitude; which, if the like
    Had been presented to my view elsewhere,
    I might have even been tempted to despise.
    But no--for the serene was also bright;
    Enlivened happiness with joy o'erflowing,                    
    With joy, and--oh! that memory should survive
    To speak the word--with rapture! Nature's boon,
    Life's genuine inspiration, happiness
    Above what rules can teach, or fancy feign;
    Abused, as all possessions _are_ abused                 
    That are not prized according to their worth.
    And yet, what worth? what good is given to men,
    More solid than the gilded clouds of heaven?
    What joy more lasting than a vernal flower?
    None! 'tis the general plaint of human kind                  
    In solitude: and mutually addressed
    From each to all, for wisdom's sake:--This truth
    The priest announces from his holy seat:
    And, crowned with garlands in the summer grove,
    The poet fits it to his pensive lyre.                        
    Yet, ere that final resting-place be gained,
    Sharp contradictions may arise, by doom
    Of this same life, compelling us to grieve
    That the prosperities of love and joy
    Should be permitted, oft-times, to endure                    
    So long, and be at once cast down for ever.
    Oh! tremble, ye, to whom hath been assigned
    A course of days composing happy months,
    And they as happy years; the present still
    So like the past, and both so firm a pledge                  
    Of a congenial future, that the wheels
    Of pleasure move without the aid of hope:
    For Mutability is Nature's bane;
    And slighted Hope _will_ be avenged; and, when
    Ye need her favours, ye shall find her not;                  
    But in her stead--fear--doubt--and agony!"

      This was the bitter language of the heart:
    But, while he spake, look, gesture, tone of voice,
    Though discomposed and vehement, were such
    As skill and graceful nature might suggest                   
    To a proficient of the tragic scene
    Standing before the multitude, beset
    With dark events. Desirous to divert
    Or stem the current of the speaker's thoughts,
    We signified a wish to leave that place                      
    Of stillness and close privacy, a nook
    That seemed for self-examination made;
    Or, for confession, in the sinner's need,
    Hidden from all men's view. To our attempt
    He yielded not; but, pointing to a slope                     
    Of mossy turf defended from the sun,
    And on that couch inviting us to rest,
    Full on that tender-hearted Man he turned
    A serious eye, and his speech thus renewed.

      "You never saw, your eyes did never look                   
    On the bright form of Her whom once I loved:--
    Her silver voice was heard upon the earth,
    A sound unknown to you; else, honoured Friend!
    Your heart had borne a pitiable share
    Of what I suffered, when I wept that loss,                   
    And suffer now, not seldom, from the thought
    That I remember, and can weep no more.--
    Stripped as I am of all the golden fruit
    Of self-esteem; and by the cutting blasts
    Of self-reproach familiarly assailed;                        
    Yet would I not be of such wintry bareness
    But that some leaf of your regard should hang
    Upon my naked branches:--lively thoughts
    Give birth, full often, to unguarded words;
    I grieve that, in your presence, from my tongue              
    Too much of frailty hath already dropped;
    But that too much demands still more.
                                           "You know,
    Revered Compatriot--and to you, kind Sir,
    (Not to be deemed a stranger, as you come
    Following the guidance of these welcome feet                 
    To our secluded vale) it may be told--
    That my demerits did not sue in vain
    To One on whose mild radiance many gazed
    With hope, and all with pleasure. This fair Bride--
    In the devotedness of youthful love,                         
    Preferring me to parents, and the choir
    Of gay companions, to the natal roof,
    And all known places and familiar sights
    (Resigned with sadness gently weighing down
    Her trembling expectations, but no more                      
    Than did to her due honour, and to me
    Yielded, that day, a confidence sublime
    In what I had to build upon)--this Bride,
    Young, modest, meek, and beautiful, I led
    To a low cottage in a sunny bay,                             
    Where the salt sea innocuously breaks,
    And the sea breeze as innocently breathes,
    On Devon's leafy shores;--a sheltered hold,
    In a soft clime encouraging the soil
    To a luxuriant bounty!--As our steps                         
    Approach the embowered abode--our chosen seat--
    See, rooted in the earth, her kindly bed,
    The unendangered myrtle, decked with flowers,
    Before the threshold stands to welcome us!
    While, in the flowering myrtle's neighbourhood,              
    Not overlooked but courting no regard,
    Those native plants, the holly and the yew,
    Gave modest intimation to the mind
    How willingly their aid they would unite
    With the green myrtle, to endear the hours                   
    Of winter, and protect that pleasant place.
    --Wild were the walks upon those lonely Downs,
    Track leading into track; how marked, how worn
    Into bright verdure, between fern and gorse,
    Winding away its never ending line                           
    On their smooth surface, evidence was none:
    But, there, lay open to our daily haunt
    A range of unappropriated earth,
    Where youth's ambitious feet might move at large;
    Whence, unmolested wanderers, we beheld                      
    The shining giver of the day diffuse
    His brightness o'er a tract of sea and land
    Gay as our spirits, free as our desires;
    As our enjoyments, boundless.--From those heights
    We dropped, at pleasure, into sylvan combs;
    Where arbours of impenetrable shade,
    And mossy seats, detained us side by side,
    With hearts at ease, and knowledge in our hearts
    'That all the grove and all the day was ours.'

      "O happy time! still happier was at hand;                  
    For Nature called my Partner to resign
    Her share in the pure freedom of that life,
    Enjoyed by us in common.--To my hope,
    To my heart's wish, my tender Mate became
    The thankful captive of maternal bonds;                      
    And those wild paths were left to me alone.
    There could I meditate on follies past;
    And, like a weary voyager escaped
    From risk and hardship, inwardly retrace
    A course of vain delights and thoughtless guilt,             
    And self-indulgence--without shame pursued.
    There, undisturbed, could think of and could thank
    Her whose submissive spirit was to me
    Rule and restraint--my guardian--shall I say
    That earthly Providence, whose guiding love                  
    Within a port of rest had lodged me safe;
    Safe from temptation, and from danger far?
    Strains followed of acknowledgment addressed
    To an Authority enthroned above                              
    The reach of sight; from whom, as from their source,
    Proceed all visible ministers of good
    That walk the earth--Father of heaven and earth,
    Father, and king, and judge, adored and feared!
    These acts of mind, and memory, and heart,
    And spirit--interrupted and relieved                         
    By observations transient as the glance
    Of flying sunbeams, or to the outward form
    Cleaving with power inherent and intense,
    As the mute insect fixed upon the plant                      
    On whose soft leaves it hangs, and from whose cup
    It draws its nourishment imperceptibly--
    Endeared my wanderings; and the mother's kiss
    And infant's smile awaited my return.

      "In privacy we dwelt, a wedded pair,
    Companions daily, often all day long;                        
    Not placed by fortune within easy reach
    Of various intercourse, nor wishing aught
    Beyond the allowance of our own fire-side,
    The twain within our happy cottage born,
    Inmates, and heirs of our united love;                       
    Graced mutually by difference of sex,
    And with no wider interval of time
    Between their several births than served for one
    To establish something of a leader's sway;
    Yet left them joined by sympathy in age;                     
    Equals in pleasure, fellows in pursuit.
    On these two pillars rested as in air
    Our solitude.
                   "It soothes me to perceive,
    Your courtesy withholds not from my words
    Attentive audience. But, oh! gentle Friends,                 
    As times of quiet and unbroken peace,
    Though, for a nation, times of blessedness,
    Give back faint echoes from the historian's page;
    So, in the imperfect sounds of this discourse,
    Depressed I hear, how faithless is the voice                 
    Which those most blissful days reverberate.
    What special record can, or need, be given
    To rules and habits, whereby much was done,
    But all within the sphere of little things;
    Of humble, though, to us, important cares,                   
    And precious interests? Smoothly did our life
    Advance, swerving not from the path prescribed;
    Her annual, her diurnal, round alike
    Maintained with faithful care. And you divine
    The worst effects that our condition saw                
    If you imagine changes slowly wrought,
    And in their progress unperceivable;
    Not wished for; sometimes noticed with a sigh,
    (Whate'er of good or lovely they might bring)
    Sighs of regret, for the familiar good                       
    And loveliness endeared which they removed.

      "Seven years of occupation undisturbed
    Established seemingly a right to hold
    That happiness; and use and habit gave
    To what an alien spirit had acquired                         
    A patrimonial sanctity. And thus,
    With thoughts and wishes bounded to this world,
    I lived and breathed; most grateful--if to enjoy
    Without repining or desire for more,
    For different lot, or change to higher sphere,               
    (Only except some impulses of pride
    With no determined object, though upheld
    By theories with suitable support)--
    Most grateful, if in such wise to enjoy
    Be proof of gratitude for what we have;                      
    Else, I allow, most thankless.--But, at once,
    From some dark seat of fatal power was urged
    A claim that shattered all.--Our blooming girl,
    Caught in the gripe of death, with such brief time
    To struggle in as scarcely would allow                       
    Her cheek to change its colour, was conveyed
    From us to inaccessible worlds, to regions
    Where height, or depth, admits not the approach
    Of living man, though longing to pursue.
    --With even as brief a warning--and how soon,                
    With what short interval of time between,
    I tremble yet to think of--our last prop,
    Our happy life's only remaining stay--
    The brother followed; and was seen no more!

      "Calm as a frozen lake when ruthless winds                 
    Blow fiercely, agitating earth and sky,
    The Mother now remained; as if in her,
    Who, to the lowest region of the soul,
    Had been erewhile unsettled and disturbed,
    This second visitation had no power                          
    To shake; but only to bind up and seal;
    And to establish thankfulness of heart
    In Heaven's determinations, ever just.
    The eminence whereon her spirit stood,
    Mine was unable to attain. Immense                           
    The space that severed us! But, as the sight
    Communicates with heaven's ethereal orbs
    Incalculably distant; so, I felt
    That consolation may descend from far
    (And that is intercourse, and union, too,)                   
    While, overcome with speechless gratitude,
    And, with a holier love inspired, I looked
    On her--at once superior to my woes
    And partner of my loss.--O heavy change!
    Dimness o'er this clear luminary crept                       
    Insensibly;--the immortal and divine
    Yielded to mortal reflux; her pure glory,
    As from the pinnacle of worldly state
    Wretched ambition drops astounded, fell
    Into a gulf obscure of silent grief,                         
    And keen heart-anguish--of itself ashamed,
    Yet obstinately cherishing itself:
    And, so consumed, she melted from my arms;
    And left me, on this earth, disconsolate!

      "What followed cannot be reviewed in thought;              
    Much less, retraced in words. If she, of life
    Blameless, so intimate with love and joy
    And all the tender motions of the soul,
    Had been supplanted, could I hope to stand--
    Infirm, dependent, and now destitute?                        
    I called on dreams and visions, to disclose
    That which is veiled from waking thought; conjured
    Eternity, as men constrain a ghost
    To appear and answer; to the grave I spake
    Imploringly;--looked up, and asked the Heavens               
    If Angels traversed their cerulean floors,
    If fixed or wandering star could tidings yield
    Of the departed spirit--what abode
    It occupies--what consciousness retains
    Of former loves and interests. Then my soul                  
    Turned inward,--to examine of what stuff
    Time's fetters are composed; and life was put
    To inquisition, long and profitless!
    By pain of heart--now checked--and now impelled--
    The intellectual power, through words and things,            
    Went sounding on, a dim and perilous way!
    And from those transports, and these toils abstruse,
    Some trace am I enabled to retain
    Of time, else lost;--existing unto me
    Only by records in myself not found.                         

      "From that abstraction I was roused,--and how?
    Even as a thoughtful shepherd by a flash
    Of lightning startled in a gloomy cave
    Of these wild hills. For, lo! the dread Bastile,
    With all the chambers in its horrid towers,                  
    Fell to the ground:--by violence overthrown
    Of indignation; and with shouts that drowned
    The crash it made in falling! From the wreck
    A golden palace rose, or seemed to rise,
    The appointed seat of equitable law                          
    And mild paternal sway. The potent shock
    I felt: the transformation I perceived,
    As marvellously seized as in that moment
    When, from the blind mist issuing, I beheld
    Glory--beyond all glory ever seen,                           
    Confusion infinite of heaven and earth,
    Dazzling the soul. Meanwhile, prophetic harps
    In every grove were ringing, 'War shall cease;
    Did ye not hear that conquest is abjured?
    Bring garlands, bring forth choicest flowers, to deck        
    The tree of Liberty.'--My heart rebounded;
    My melancholy voice the chorus joined;
    --'Be joyful all ye nations; in all lands,
    Ye that are capable of joy be glad!
    Henceforth, whate'er is wanting to yourselves                
    In others ye shall promptly find;--and all,
    Enriched by mutual and reflected wealth,
    Shall with one heart honour their common kind.'

      "Thus was I reconverted to the world;
    Society became my glittering bride,                          
    And airy hopes my children.--From the depths
    Of natural passion, seemingly escaped,
    My soul diffused herself in wide embrace
    Of institutions, and the forms of things,
    As they exist, in mutable array,                             
    Upon life's surface. What, though in my veins
    There flowed no Gallic blood, nor had I breathed
    The air of France, not less than Gallic zeal
    Kindled and burnt among the sapless twigs
    Of my exhausted heart. If busy men                           
    In sober conclave met, to weave a web
    Of amity, whose living threads should stretch
    Beyond the seas, and to the farthest pole,
    There did I sit, assisting. If, with noise
    And acclamation, crowds in open air                          
    Expressed the tumult of their minds, my voice
    There mingled, heard or not. The powers of song
    I left not uninvoked; and, in still groves,
    Where mild enthusiasts tuned a pensive lay
    Of thanks and expectation, in accord                         
    With their belief, I sang Saturnian rule
    Returned,--a progeny of golden years
    Permitted to descend, and bless mankind.
    --With promises the Hebrew Scriptures teem:
    I felt their invitation; and resumed                    
    A long-suspended office in the House
    Of public worship, where, the glowing phrase
    Of ancient inspiration serving me,
    I promised also,--with undaunted trust
    Foretold, and added prayer to prophecy;                      
    The admiration winning of the crowd;
    The help desiring of the pure devout.

      "Scorn and contempt forbid me to proceed!
    But History, time's slavish scribe, will tell
    How rapidly the zealots of the cause                         
    Disbanded--or in hostile ranks appeared;
    Some, tired of honest service; these, outdone,
    Disgusted therefore, or appalled, by aims
    Of fiercer zealots--so confusion reigned,
    And the more faithful were compelled to exclaim,             
    As Brutus did to Virtue, 'Liberty,
    I worshipped thee, and find thee but a Shade!'

      "Such recantation had for me no charm,
    Nor would I bend to it; who should have grieved
    At aught, however fair, that bore the mien              
    Of a conclusion, or catastrophe.
    Why then conceal, that, when the simply good
    In timid selfishness withdrew, I sought
    Other support, not scrupulous whence it came;
    And, by what compromise it stood, not nice?                  
    Enough if notions seemed to be high-pitched,
    And qualities determined.--Among men
    So charactered did I maintain a strife
    Hopeless, and still more hopeless every hour;
    But, in the process, I began to feel                         
    That, if the emancipation of the world
    Were missed, I should at least secure my own,
    And be in part compensated. For rights,
    Widely--inveterately usurped upon,
    I spake with vehemence; and promptly seized                  
    All that Abstraction furnished for my needs
    Or purposes; nor scrupled to proclaim,
    And propagate, by liberty of life,
    Those new persuasions. Not that I rejoiced,
    Or even found pleasure, in such vagrant course,              
    For its own sake; but farthest from the walk
    Which I had trod in happiness and peace,
    Was most inviting to a troubled mind;
    That, in a struggling and distempered world,
    Saw a seductive image of herself.
    Yet, mark the contradictions of which Man
    Is still the sport! Here Nature was my guide,
    The Nature of the dissolute; but thee,
    O fostering Nature! I rejected--smiled
    At others' tears in pity; and in scorn                       
    At those, which thy soft influence sometimes drew
    From my unguarded heart.--The tranquil shores
    Of Britain circumscribed me; else, perhaps
    I might have been entangled among deeds,
    Which, now, as infamous, I should abhor--                    
    Despise, as senseless: for my spirit relished
    Strangely the exasperation of that Land,
    Which turned an angry beak against the down
    Of her own breast; confounded into hope
    Of disencumbering thus her fretful wings.

      "But all was quieted by iron bonds
    Of military sway. The shifting aims,
    The moral interests, the creative might,
    The varied functions and high attributes
    Of civil action, yielded to a power                          
    Formal, and odious, and contemptible.
    --In Britain, ruled a panic dread of change;
    The weak were praised, rewarded, and advanced;
    And, from the impulse of a just disdain,
    Once more did I retire into myself.                          
    There feeling no contentment, I resolved
    To fly, for safeguard, to some foreign shore,
    Remote from Europe; from her blasted hopes;
    Her fields of carnage, and polluted air.                     

      "Fresh blew the wind, when o'er the Atlantic Main
    The ship went gliding with her thoughtless crew;
    And who among them but an Exile, freed
    From discontent, indifferent, pleased to sit
    Among the busily-employed, not more
    With obligation charged, with service taxed,                 
    Than the loose pendant--to the idle wind
    Upon the tall mast streaming. But, ye Powers
    Of soul and sense mysteriously allied,
    O, never let the Wretched, if a choice
    Be left him, trust the freight of his distress               
    To a long voyage on the silent deep!
    For, like a plague, will memory break out;
    And, in the blank and solitude of things,
    Upon his spirit, with a fever's strength,
    Will conscience prey.--Feebly must they have felt            
    Who, in old time, attired with snakes and whips
    The vengeful Furies. _Beautiful_ regards
    Were turned on me--the face of her I loved;
    The Wife and Mother pitifully fixing
    Tender reproaches, insupportable!                            
    Where now that boasted liberty? No welcome
    From unknown objects I received; and those,
    Known and familiar, which the vaulted sky
    Did, in the placid clearness of the night,
    Disclose, had accusations to prefer                          
    Against my peace. Within the cabin stood
    That volume--as a compass for the soul--
    Revered among the nations. I implored
    Its guidance; but the infallible support
    Of faith was wanting. Tell me, why refused                   
    To One by storms annoyed and adverse winds;
    Perplexed with currents; of his weakness sick;
    Of vain endeavours tired; and by his own,
    And by his nature's, ignorance, dismayed!                    

      "Long wished-for sight, the Western World appeared;
    And, when the ship was moored, I leaped ashore
    Indignantly--resolved to be a man,
    Who, having o'er the past no power, would live
    No longer in subjection to the past,
    With abject mind--from a tyrannic lord                       
    Inviting penance, fruitlessly endured:
    So, like a fugitive, whose feet have cleared
    Some boundary, which his followers may not cross
    In prosecution of their deadly chase,
    Respiring I looked round.--How bright the sun,               
    The breeze how soft! Can any thing produced
    In the old World compare, thought I, for power
    And majesty with this gigantic stream,
    Sprung from the desert? And behold a city                
    Fresh, youthful, and aspiring! What are these
    To me, or I to them? As much at least
    As he desires that they should be, whom winds
    And waves have wafted to this distant shore,
    In the condition of a damaged seed,
    Whose fibres cannot, if they would, take root.               
    Here may I roam at large;--my business is,
    Roaming at large, to observe, and not to feel
    And, therefore, not to act--convinced that all
    Which bears the name of action, howsoe'er
    Beginning, ends in servitude--still painful,                 
    And mostly profitless. And, sooth to say,
    On nearer view, a motley spectacle
    Appeared, of high pretensions--unreproved
    But by the obstreperous voice of higher still;
    Big passions strutting on a petty stage;                     
    Which a detached spectator may regard
    Not unamused.--But ridicule demands
    Quick change of objects; and, to laugh alone,
    At a composing distance from the haunts
    Of strife and folly, though it be a treat                    
    As choice as musing Leisure can bestow;
    Yet, in the very centre of the crowd,
    To keep the secret of a poignant scorn,
    Howe'er to airy Demons suitable,
    Of all unsocial courses, is least fit
    For the gross spirit of mankind,--the one
    That soonest fails to please, and quickliest turns
    Into vexation.
                   "Let us, then, I said,
    Leave this unknit Republic to the scourge
    Of her own passions; and to regions haste,              
    Whose shades have never felt the encroaching axe,
    Or soil endured a transfer in the mart
    Of dire rapacity. There, Man abides,
    Primeval Nature's child. A creature weak
    In combination, (wherefore else driven back                  
    So far, and of his old inheritance
    So easily deprived?) but, for that cause,
    More dignified, and stronger in himself;
    Whether to act, judge, suffer, or enjoy.
    True, the intelligence of social art                         
    Hath overpowered his forefathers, and soon
    Will sweep the remnant of his line away;
    But contemplations, worthier, nobler far
    Than her destructive energies, attend
    His independence, when along the side                        
    Of Mississippi, or that northern stream
    That spreads into successive seas, he walks;
    Pleased to perceive his own unshackled life,
    And his innate capacities of soul,
    There imaged: or when, having gained the top                 
    Of some commanding eminence, which yet
    Intruder ne'er beheld, he thence surveys
    Regions of wood and wide savannah, vast
    Expanse of unappropriated earth,
    With mind that sheds a light on what he sees;                
    Free as the sun, and lonely as the sun,
    Pouring above his head its radiance down
    Upon a living and rejoicing world!

      "So, westward, tow'rd the unviolated woods
    I bent my way; and, roaming far and wide,                    
    Failed not to greet the merry Mocking-bird;
    And, while the melancholy Muccawiss
    (The sportive bird's companion in the grove)
    Repeated, o'er and o'er, his plaintive cry,
    I sympathised at leisure with the sound;                     
    But that pure archetype of human greatness,
    I found him not. There, in his stead, appeared
    A creature, squalid, vengeful, and impure;
    Remorseless, and submissive to no law
    But superstitious fear, and abject sloth.                    

      "Enough is told! Here am I--ye have heard
    What evidence I seek, and vainly seek;
    What from my fellow-beings I require,
    And either they have not to give, or I
    Lack virtue to receive; what I myself,                      
    Too oft by wilful forfeiture, have lost
    Nor can regain. How languidly I look
    Upon this visible fabric of the world,
    May be divined--perhaps it hath been said:--
    But spare your pity, if there be in me                       
    Aught that deserves respect: for I exist,
    Within myself, not comfortless.--The tenour
    Which my life holds, he readily may conceive
    Whoe'er hath stood to watch a mountain brook
    In some still passage of its course, and seen,               
    Within the depths of its capacious breast,
    Inverted trees, rocks, clouds, and azure sky;
    And, on its glassy surface, specks of foam,
    And conglobated bubbles undissolved,
    Numerous as stars; that, by their onward lapse,              
    Betray to sight the motion of the stream,
    Else imperceptible. Meanwhile, is heard
    A softened roar, or murmur; and the sound
    Though soothing, and the little floating isles
    Though beautiful, are both by Nature charged                 
    With the same pensive office; and make known
    Through what perplexing labyrinths, abrupt
    Precipitations, and untoward straits,
    The earth-born wanderer hath passed; and quickly,
    That respite o'er, like traverses and toils                  
    Must he again encounter.--Such a stream
    Is human Life; and so the Spirit fares
    In the best quiet to her course allowed;
    And such is mine,--save only for a hope
    That my particular current soon will reach                   
    The unfathomable gulf, where all is still!"
