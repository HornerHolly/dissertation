 This Lawn, a carpet all alive
    With shadows flung from leaves--to strive
      In dance, amid a press
    Of sunshine, an apt emblem yields
    Of Worldlings revelling in the fields                              
      Of strenuous idleness;

    Less quick the stir when tide and breeze
    Encounter, and to narrow seas
      Forbid a moment's rest;
    The medley less when boreal Lights                                
    Glance to and fro, like aery Sprites
      To feats of arms addrest!

    Yet, spite of all this eager strife,
    This ceaseless play, the genuine life
      That serves the stedfast hours,                                 
    Is in the grass beneath, that grows
    Unheeded, and the mute repose
      Of sweetly-breathing flowers.
