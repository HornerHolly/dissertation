    Oh Life! without thy chequered scene
    Of right and wrong, of weal and woe,
    Success and failure, could a ground
    For magnanimity be found;
    For faith, 'mid ruin'd hopes, serene?                          
    Or whence could virtue flow?

    Pain entered through a ghastly breach--
    Nor while sin lasts must effort cease;
    Heaven upon earth's an empty boast;
    But, for the bowers of Eden lost,                             
    Mercy has placed within our reach
    A portion of God's peace.
