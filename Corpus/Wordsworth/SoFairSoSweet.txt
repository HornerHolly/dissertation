So fair, so sweet, withal so sensitive,
    Would that the little Flowers were born to live,
    Conscious of half the pleasure which they give;

    That to this mountain-daisy’s self were known
    The beauty of its star-shaped shadow, thrown                       
    On the smooth surface of this naked stone!

    And what if hence a bold desire should mount
    High as the Sun, that he could take account
    Of all that issues from his glorious fount!

    So might he ken how by his sovereign aid                         
    These delicate companionships are made;
    And how he rules the pomp of light and shade;

    And were the Sister-power that shines by night
    So privileged, what a countenance of delight
    Would through the clouds break forth on human sight!              

    Fond fancies! wheresoe’er shall turn thine eye
    On earth, air, ocean, or the starry sky,
    Converse with Nature in pure sympathy;

    All vain desires, all lawless wishes quelled,
    Be Thou to love and praise alike impelled,                        
    Whatever boon is granted or withheld.
