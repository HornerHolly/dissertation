 Avaunt this œconomic rage!
    What would it bring?--an iron age,
    Where Fact with heartless search explored
    Shall be Imagination’s Lord,
    And sway with absolute controul                                    
    The god-like Functions of the Soul.
    Not _thus_ can knowledge elevate
    Our Nature from her fallen state.
    With sober Reason Faith unites
    To vindicate the ideal rights                                     
    Of human-kind--the tone agreeing
    Of objects with internal seeing,
    Of effort with the end of Being.
