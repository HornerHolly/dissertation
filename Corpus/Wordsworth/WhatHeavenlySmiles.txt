    What heavenly smiles! O Lady mine
    Through my very heart they shine;
    And, if my brow gives back their light,
    Do thou look gladly on the sight;
    As the clear Moon with modest pride
      Beholds her own bright beams
    Reflected from the mountains side
      And from the headlong streams.
