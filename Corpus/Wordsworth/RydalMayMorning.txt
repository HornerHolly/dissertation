If with old love of you, dear Hills! I share
    New love of many a rival image brought
    From far, forgive the wanderings of my thought:
    Nor art thou wronged, sweet May! when I compare
    Thy present birth-morn with thy last, so fair,           
    So rich to me in favours. For my lot
    Then was, within the famed Egerian Grot
    To sit and muse, fanned by its dewy air
    Mingling with thy soft breath! That morning too,
    Warblers I heard their joy unbosoming                             
    Amid the sunny, shadowy, Coliseum;
    Heard them, unchecked by aught of saddening hue,
    For victories there won by flower-crowned Spring,
    Chant in full choir their innocent Te Deum.
