The Kirk of Ulpha to the pilgrim's eye
    Is welcome as a star, that doth present
    Its shining forehead through the peaceful rent
    Of a black cloud diffused o'er half the sky:
    Or as a fruitful palm-tree towering high                       
    O'er the parched waste beside an Arab's tent;
    Or the Indian tree whose branches, downward bent,
    Take root again, a boundless canopy.
    How sweet were leisure! could it yield no more
    Than 'mid that wave-washed Church-yard to recline,            
    From pastoral graves extracting thoughts divine;
    Or there to pace, and mark the summits hoar
    Of distant moon-lit mountains faintly shine,
    Soothed by the unseen River's gentle roar.
