 Stretched on the dying Mother's lap, lies dead
    Her new-born Babe; dire ending of bright hope!
    But Sculpture here, with the divinest scope
    Of luminous faith, heavenward hath raised that head
    So patiently; and through one hand has spread                      
    A touch so tender for the insensate Child--
    (Earth's lingering love to parting reconciled,
    Brief parting, for the spirit is all but fled)--
    That we, who contemplate the turns of life
    Through this still medium, are consoled and cheered;
    Feel with the Mother, think the severed Wife                      
    Is less to be lamented than revered;
    And own that Art, triumphant over strife
    And pain, hath powers to Eternity endeared.
