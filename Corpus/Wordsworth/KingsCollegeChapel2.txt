What awful p√©rspective! while from our sight
    With gradual stealth the lateral windows hide
    Their Portraitures, their stone-work glimmers, dyed
    In the soft chequerings of a sleepy light.
    Martyr, or King, or sainted Eremite,                               
    Whoe'er ye be, that thus, yourselves unseen,
    Imbue your prison-bars with solemn sheen,
    Shine on, until ye fade with coming Night!--
    But, from the arms of silence--list! O list!
    The music bursteth into second life;                              
    The notes luxuriate, every stone is kissed
    By sound, or ghost of sound, in mazy strife;
    Heart-thrilling strains, that cast, before the eye
    Of the devout, a veil of ecstasy!
