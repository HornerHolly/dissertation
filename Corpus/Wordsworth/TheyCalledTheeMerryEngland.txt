They called Thee MERRY ENGLAND, in old time;
    A happy people won for thee that name
    With envy heard in many a distant clime;
    And, spite of change, for me thou keep'st the same
    Endearing title, a responsive chime                                
    To the heart's fond belief; though some there are
    Whose sterner judgments deem that world a snare
    For inattentive Fancy, like the lime
    Which foolish birds are caught with. Can, I ask,
    This face of rural beauty be a mask                               
    For discontent, and poverty, and crime;
    These spreading towns a cloak for lawless will?
    Forbid it, Heaven!-and MERRY ENGLAND still
    Shall be thy rightful name, in prose and rhyme!
