From Rite and Ordinance abused they fled
    To Wilds where both were utterly unknown;
    But not to them had Providence foreshown
    What benefits are missed, what evils bred,
    In worship neither raised nor limited                              
    Save by Self-will. Lo! from that distant shore,
    For Rite and Ordinance, Piety is led
    Back to the Land those Pilgrims left of yore,
    Led by her own free choice. So Truth and Love
    By Conscience governed do their steps retrace.--                  
    Fathers! your Virtues, such the power of grace,
    Their spirit, in your Children, thus approve.
    Transcendent over time, unbound by place,
    Concord and Charity in circles move.
