    Near Anios stream, I spied a gentle Dove
    Perched on an olive branch, and heard her cooing
    Mid new-born blossoms that soft airs were wooing,
    While all things present told of joy and love.
    But restless Fancy left that olive grove                           
    To hail the exploratory Bird renewing
    Hope for the few, who, at the worlds undoing,
    On the great flood were spared to live and move.
    O bounteous Heaven! signs true as dove and bough
    Brought to the ark are coming evermore,                           
    Given though we seek them not, but, while we plough
    This sea of life without a visible shore,
    Do neither promise ask nor grace implore
    In what alone is ours, the living Now.
