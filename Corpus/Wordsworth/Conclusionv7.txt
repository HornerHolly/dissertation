Why sleeps the future, as a snake enrolled,
    Coil within coil, at noon-tide? For the WORD
    Yields, if with unpresumptuous faith explored,
    Power at whose touch the sluggard shall unfold
    His drowsy rings. Look forth!--that Stream behold,
    THAT STREAM upon whose bosom we have passed                        
    Floating at ease while nations have effaced
    Nations, and Death has gathered to his fold
    Long lines of mighty Kings--look forth, my Soul!
    (Nor in this vision be thou slow to trust)                   
    The living Waters, less and less by guilt
    Stained and polluted, brighten as they roll,
    Till they have reached the eternal City--built
    For the perfected Spirits of the just!
