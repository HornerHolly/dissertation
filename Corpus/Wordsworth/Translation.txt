 Rid of a vexing and a heavy load,
    Eternal Lord! and from the world set free,
    Like a frail Bark, weary I turn to Thee,
    From frightful storms into a quiet road.
    On much repentance Grace will be bestowd.                         
    The nails, the thorns, and thy two hands, thy face
    Benign, meek  offers grace
    To sinners whom their sins oppress and goad.
    Let not thy justice view, O Light Divine,
    My fault, and keep it from thy sacred ear.                        

    Cleanse with thy blood my sins, to this incline
    More readily, the more my years require
    Prompt aid, forgiveness speedy and entire.
