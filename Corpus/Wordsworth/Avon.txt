Avon a precious, an immortal name!
    Yet is it one that other rivulets bear
    Like this unheard of, and their channels wear
    Like this contented, though unknown to Fame
    For great and sacred is the modest claim                           
    Of Streams to Nature love, whereer they flow;
    And never did Genius slight them, as they go,
    Tree, flower, and green herb, feeding without blame.
    But Praise can waste her voice on work of tears,
    Anguish, and death full oft where innocent blood                 
    Has mixed its current with the limpid flood,
    Her heaven offending trophies Glory rears
    Never for like distinction may the good
    Shrink from thy name, pure Rill, with unpleased ears.
