 Sylph was it? or a Bird more bright
      Than those of fabulous stock?
    A second darted by;--and lo!
      Another of the flock,
    Through sunshine flitting from the bough                           
      To nestle in the rock.
    Transient deception! a gay freak
      Of April's mimicries!
    Those brilliant strangers, hailed with joy
      Among the budding trees,                                        
    Proved last year's leaves, pushed from the spray
      To frolic on the breeze.

    Maternal Flora! show thy face,
      And let thy hand be seen,
    Thy hand here sprinkling tiny flowers,
      That, as they touch the green,
    Take root (so seems it) and look up
      In honour of their Queen.
    Yet, sooth, those little starry specks,
      That not in vain aspired                                        
    To be confounded with live growths,
      Most dainty, most admired,
    Were only blossoms dropped from twigs
      Of their own offspring tired.

    Not such the World's illusive shows;                              
      _Her_ wingless flutterings,
    Her blossoms which, though shed, outbrave
      The floweret as it springs,
    For the undeceived, smile as they may,
      Are melancholy things:                                          
    But gentle Nature plays her part
      With ever-varying wiles,
    And transient feignings with plain truth
      So well she reconciles,
    That those fond Idlers most are pleased                           
      Whom oftenest she beguiles.
