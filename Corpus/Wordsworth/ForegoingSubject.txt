 Among a grave fraternity of Monks,
    For One, but surely not for One alone,
    Triumphs, in that great work, the Painterâ€™s skill,
    Humbling the body, to exalt the soul;
    Yet representing, amid wreck and wrong                             
    And dissolution and decay, the warm
    And breathing life of flesh, as if already
    Clothed with impassive majesty, and graced
    With no mean earnest of a heritage
    Assigned to it in future worlds. Thou, too,                       
    With thy memorial flower, meek Portraiture!
    From whose serene companionship I passed
    Pursued by thoughts that haunt me still; thou also--
    Though but a simple object, into light
    Called forth by those affections that endear                      
    The private hearth; though keeping thy sole seat
    In singleness, and little tried by time,
    Creation, as it were, of yesterday--
    With a congenial function art endued
    For each and all of us, together joined                           
    In course of nature under a low roof
    By charities and duties that proceed
    Out of the bosom of a wiser vow.
    To a like salutary sense of awe
    Or sacred wonder, growing with the power                          
    Of meditation that attempts to weigh,
    In faithful scales, things and their opposites,
    Can thy enduring quiet gently raise
    A household small and sensitive,--whose love,
    Dependent as in part its blessings are                            
    Upon frail ties dissolving or dissolved
    On earth, will be revived, we trust, in heaven.
