 While poring Antiquarians search the ground
    Upturned with curious pains, the Bard, a Seer,
    Takes fire:----The men that have been reappear;
    Romans for travel girt, for business gowned;
    And some recline on couches, myrtle-crowned,                       
    In festal glee: why not? For fresh and clear,
    As if its hues were of the passing year,
    Dawns this time-buried pavement. From that mound
    Hoards may come forth of Trajans, Maximins,
    Shrunk into coins with all their warlike toil:                    
    Or a fierce impress issues with its foil
    Of tenderness--the Wolf, whose suckling Twins
    The unlettered ploughboy pities when he wins
    The casual treasure from the furrowed soil.
