 Tranquillity! the sovereign aim wert thou
    In heathen schools of philosophic lore;
    Heart-stricken by stern destiny of yore
    The Tragic Muse thee served with thoughtful vow;
    And what of hope Elysium could allow                               
    Was fondly seized by Sculpture, to restore
    Peace to the Mourner. But when He who wore
    The crown of thorns around his bleeding brow
    Warmed our sad being with celestial light,
    _Then_ Arts which still had drawn a softening grace               
    From shadowy fountains of the Infinite,
    Communed with that Idea face to face:
    And move around it now as planets run,
    Each in its orbit round the central Sun.
