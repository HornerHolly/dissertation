 "Woe to you, Prelates! rioting in ease
    "And cumbrous wealth--the shame of your estate;
    "You, on whose progress dazzling trains await
    "Of pompous horses; whom vain titles please;
    "Who will be served by others on their knees,                      
    "Yet will yourselves to God no service pay;
    "Pastors who neither take nor point the way
    "To Heaven; for, either lost in vanities
    "Ye have no skill to teach, or if ye know
    "And speak the word ----" Alas! of fearful things
    'Tis the most fearful when the people's eye                       
    Abuse hath cleared from vain imaginings;
    And taught the general voice to prophesy
    Of Justice armed, and Pride to be laid low.
