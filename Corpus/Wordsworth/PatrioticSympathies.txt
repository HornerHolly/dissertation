 Last night, without a voice, that Vision spake
    Fear to my Soul, and sadness which might seem
    Wholly dissevered from our present theme;
    Yet, my belov√®d Country! I partake
    Of kindred agitations for thy sake;                                
    Thou, too, dost visit oft my midnight dream;
    Thy glory meets me with the earliest beam
    Of light, which tells that Morning is awake.
    If aught impair thy beauty or destroy,
    Or but forebode destruction, I deplore                            
    With filial love the sad vicissitude;
    If thou hast fallen, and righteous Heaven restore
    The prostrate, then my spring-time is renewed,
    And sorrow bartered for exceeding joy.
