What aspect bore the Man who roved or fled,
    First of his tribe, to this dark dell who first
    In this pellucid Current slaked his thirst?
    What hopes came with him? what designs were spread
    Along his path? His unprotected bed                            
    What dreams encompassed? Was the intruder nursed
    In hideous usages, and rites accursed,
    That thinned the living and disturbed the dead?
    No voice replies both air and earth are mute;
    And Thou, blue Streamlet, murmuring yield'st no more          
    Than a soft record, that, whatever fruit
    Of ignorance thou mightst witness heretofore,
    Thy function was to heal and to restore,
    To soothe and cleanse, not madden and pollute!
