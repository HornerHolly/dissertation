 Mid-noon is past;--upon the sultry mead
    No zephyr breathes, no cloud its shadow throws:
    If we advance unstrengthened by repose,
    Farewell the solace of the vagrant reed!
    This Nook with woodbine hung and straggling weed,        
    Tempting recess as ever pilgrim chose,
    Half grot, half arbour--proffers to enclose
    Body and mind, from molestation freed,
    In narrow compass--narrow as itself:
    Or if the Fancy, too industrious Elf,                         
    Be loth that we should breathe awhile exempt
    From new incitements friendly to our task,
    Here wants not stealthy prospect, that may tempt
    Loose Idless to forego her wily mask.
