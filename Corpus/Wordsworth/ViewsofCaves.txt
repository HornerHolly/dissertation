    Pure element of waters! wheresoeer
    Thou dost forsake thy subterranean haunts,
    Green herbs, bright flowers, and berry bearing plants,
    Rise into life and in thy train appear:
    And, through the sunny portion of the year,                    
    Swift insects shine, thy hovering pursuivants:
    And, if thy bounty fail, the forest pants;
    And hart and hind and hunter with his spear,
    Languish and droop together. Nor unfelt
    In mans perturbed soul thy sway benign;                      
    And, haply, far within the marble belt
    Of central earth, where tortured Spirits pine
    For grace and goodness lost, thy murmurs melt
    Their anguish, and they blend sweet songs with thine.
