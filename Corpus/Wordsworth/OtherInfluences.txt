 Ah, when the Body, round which in love we clung,
    Is chilled by death, does mutual service fail?
    Is tender pity then of no avail?
    Are intercessions of the fervent tongue
    A waste of hope?--From this sad source have sprung
    Rites that console the Spirit, under grief                        
    Which ill can brook more rational relief:
    Hence, prayers are shaped amiss, and dirges sung
    For Souls whose doom is fixed! The way is smooth
    For Power that travels with the human heart:                      
    Confession ministers the pang to soothe
    In him who at the ghost of guilt doth start.
    Ye holy Men, so earnest in your care,
    Of your own mighty instruments beware!
