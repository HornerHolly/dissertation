  Behold an emblem of our human mind
    Crowded with thoughts that need a settled home
    Yet, like to eddying balls of foam
    Within this whirlpool, they each other chase
    Round and round, and neither find
    An outlet nor a resting-place!
    Stranger, if such disquietude be thine,
    Fall on thy knees and sue for help divine.
