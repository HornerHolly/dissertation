  Here closed the Tenant of that lonely vale
    His mournful narrative--commenced in pain,
    In pain commenced, and ended without peace:
    Yet tempered, not unfrequently, with strains
    Of native feeling, grateful to our minds;                      
    And yielding surely some relief to his,
    While we sate listening with compassion due.
    A pause of silence followed; then, with voice
    That did not falter though the heart was moved,
    The Wanderer said:--
                          "One adequate support                   
    For the calamities of mortal life
    Exists--one only; an assured belief
    That the procession of our fate, howe'er
    Sad or disturbed, is ordered by a Being
    Of infinite benevolence and power;                           
    Whose everlasting purposes embrace
    All accidents, converting them to good.
    --The darts of anguish _fix_ not where the seat
    Of suffering hath been thoroughly fortified
    By acquiescence in the Will supreme                          
    For time and for eternity; by faith,
    Faith absolute in God, including hope,
    And the defence that lies in boundless love
    Of his perfections; with habitual dread
    Of aught unworthily conceived, endured                       
    Impatiently, ill-done, or left undone,
    To the dishonour of his holy name.
    Soul of our Souls, and safeguard of the world!
    Sustain, thou only canst, the sick of heart;
    Restore their languid spirits, and recal                      
    Their lost affections unto thee and thine!"

      Then, as we issued from that covert nook,
    He thus continued, lifting up his eyes
    To heaven:--"How beautiful this dome of sky;
    And the vast hills, in fluctuation fixed                      
    At thy command, how awful! Shall the Soul,
    Human and rational, report of thee
    Even less than these?--Be mute who will, who can,
    Yet I will praise thee with impassioned voice:
    My lips, that may forgot thee in the crowd,  
    Cannot forget thee here; where thou hast built,
    For thy own glory, in the wilderness!
    Me didst thou constitute a priest of thine,
    In such a temple as we now behold
    Reared for thy presence: therefore, am I bound                
    To worship, here, and every where--as one
    Not doomed to ignorance, though forced to tread,
    From childhood up, the ways of poverty;
    From unreflecting ignorance preserved,
    And from debasement rescued.--By thy grace                    
    The particle divine remained unquenched;
    And, 'mid the wild weeds of a rugged soil,
    Thy bounty caused to flourish deathless flowers,
    From paradise transplanted: wintry age
    Impends; the frost will gather round my heart;                
    If the flowers wither, I am worse than dead!
    --Come, labour, when the worn-out frame requires
    Perpetual sabbath; come, disease and want;
    And sad exclusion through decay of sense;
    But leave me unabated trust in thee--                         
    And let thy favour, to the end of life,
    Inspire me with ability to seek
    Repose and hope among eternal things--
    Father of heaven and earth! and I am rich,
    And will possess my portion in content!                       

      "And what are things eternal?--powers depart,"
    The grey-haired Wanderer stedfastly replied,
    Answering the question which himself had asked,
    "Possessions vanish, and opinions change,
    And passions hold a fluctuating seat:                         
    But, by the storms of circumstance unshaken,
    And subject neither to eclipse nor wane,
    Duty exists;--immutably survive,
    For our support, the measures and the forms,
    Which an abstract intelligence supplies;                      
    Whose kingdom is, where time and space are not.
    Of other converse which mind, soul, and heart
    Do, with united urgency, require,
    What more that may not perish?--Thou, dread source,
    Prime, self-existing cause and end of all                     
    That in the scale of being fill their place;
    Above our human region, or below,
    Set and sustained;--thou, who didst wrap the cloud
    Of infancy around us, that thyself,
    Therein, with our simplicity awhile                           
    Might'st hold, on earth, communion undisturbed;
    Who from the anarchy of dreaming sleep,
    Or from its death-like void, with punctual care,
    And touch as gentle as the morning light,
    Restor'st us, daily, to the powers of sense                   
    And reason's stedfast rule--thou, thou alone
    Art everlasting, and the blessed Spirits,
    Which thou includest, as the sea her waves:
    For adoration thou endur'st; endure
    For consciousness the motions of thy will;                    
    For apprehension those transcendent truths
    Of the pure intellect, that stand as laws
    (Submission constituting strength and power)
    Even to thy Being's infinite majesty!
    This universe shall pass away--a work
    Glorious! because the shadow of thy might,
    A step, or link, for intercourse with thee.
    Ah! if the time must come, in which my feet
    No more shall stray where meditation leads,
    By flowing stream, through wood, or craggy wild,             
    Loved haunts like these; the unimprisoned Mind
    May yet have scope to range among her own,
    Her thoughts, her images, her high desires.
    If the dear faculty of sight should fail,
    Still, it may be allowed me to remember                      
    What visionary powers of eye and soul
    In youth were mine; when, stationed on the top
    Of some huge hill--expectant, I beheld
    The sun rise up, from distant climes returned
    Darkness to chase, and sleep; and bring the day              
    His bounteous gift! or saw him toward the deep
    Sink, with a retinue of flaming clouds
    Attended; then, my spirit was entranced
    With joy exalted to beatitude;
    The measure of my soul was filled with bliss,                
    And holiest love; as earth, sea, air, with light,
    With pomp, with glory, with magnificence!

      "Those fervent raptures are for ever flown;
    And, since their date, my soul hath undergone
    Change manifold, for better or for worse:                    
    Yet cease I not to struggle, and aspire
    Heavenward; and chide the part of me that flags,
    Through sinful choice; or dread necessity
    On human nature from above imposed.
    'Tis, by comparison, an easy task                            
    Earth to despise; but, to converse with heaven--
    This is not easy:--to relinquish all
    We have, or hope, of happiness and joy,
    And stand in freedom loosened from this world,
    I deem not arduous; but must needs confess                   
    That 'tis a thing impossible to frame
    Conceptions equal to the soul's desires;
    And the most difficult of tasks to _keep_
    Heights which the soul is competent to gain.
    --Man is of dust: ethereal hopes are his,                    
    Which, when they should sustain themselves aloft,
    Want due consistence; like a pillar of smoke,
    That with majestic energy from earth
    Rises; but, having reached the thinner air,
    Melts, and dissolves, and is no longer seen.                 
    From this infirmity of mortal kind
    Sorrow proceeds, which else were not; at least,
    If grief be something hallowed and ordained,
    If, in proportion, it be just and meet,
    Yet, through this weakness of the general heart,             
    Is it enabled to maintain its hold
    In that excess which conscience disapproves.
    For who could sink and settle to that point
    Of selfishness; so senseless who could be
    As long and perseveringly to mourn                      
    For any object of his love, removed
    From this unstable world, if he could fix
    A satisfying view upon that state
    Of pure, imperishable, blessedness,
    Which reason promises, and holy writ                         
    Ensures to all believers?--Yet mistrust
    Is of such incapacity, methinks,
    No natural branch; despondency far less;
    And, least of all, is absolute despair.
    --And, if there be whose tender frames have drooped
    Even to the dust; apparently, through weight
    Of anguish unrelieved, and lack of power
    An agonizing sorrow to transmute;
    Deem not that proof is here of hope withheld
    When wanted most; a confidence impaired                      
    So pitiably, that, having ceased to see
    With bodily eyes, they are borne down by love
    Of what is lost, and perish through regret.
    Oh! no, the innocent Sufferer often sees
    Too clearly; feels too vividly; and longs                    
    To realize the vision, with intense
    And over-constant yearning;--there--there lies
    The excess, by which the balance is destroyed.
    Too, too contracted are these walls of flesh,
    This vital warmth too cold, these visual orbs,               
    Though inconceivably endowed, too dim
    For any passion of the soul that leads
    To ecstasy; and, all the crooked paths
    Of time and change disdaining, takes its course
    Along the line of limitless desires.                         
    I, speaking now from such disorder free,
    Nor rapt, nor craving, but in settled peace,
    I cannot doubt that they whom you deplore
    Are glorified; or, if they sleep, shall wake
    From sleep, and dwell with God in endless love.              
    Hope, below this, consists not with belief
    In mercy, carried infinite degrees
    Beyond the tenderness of human hearts:
    Hope, below this, consists not with belief
    In perfect wisdom, guiding mightiest power,                  
    That finds no limits but her own pure will.

      "Here then we rest; not fearing for our creed
    The worst that human reasoning can achieve,
    To unsettle or perplex it: yet with pain
    Acknowledging, and grievous self-reproach,                   
    That, though immovably convinced, we want
    Zeal, and the virtue to exist by faith
    As soldiers live by courage; as, by strength
    Of heart, the sailor fights with roaring seas.
    Alas! the endowment of immortal power                        
    Is matched unequally with custom, time,
    And domineering faculties of sense
    In _all;_ in most with superadded foes,
    Idle temptations; open vanities,
    Ephemeral offspring of the unblushing world;            
    And, in the private regions of the mind,
    Ill-governed passions, ranklings of despite,
    Immoderate wishes, pining discontent,
    Distress and care. What then remains?--To seek
    Those helps for his occasions ever near                      
    Who lacks not will to use them; vows, renewed
    On the first motion of a holy thought;
    Vigils of contemplation; praise; and prayer--
    A stream, which, from the fountain of the heart
    Issuing, however feebly, nowhere flows                       
    Without access of unexpected strength.
    But, above all, the victory is most sure
    For him, who, seeking faith by virtue, strives
    To yield entire submission to the law
    Of conscience--conscience reverenced and obeyed,             
    As God's most intimate presence in the soul,
    And his most perfect image in the world.
    --Endeavour thus to live; these rules regard;
    These helps solicit; and a stedfast seat
    Shall then be yours among the happy few                      
    Who dwell on earth, yet breathe empyreal air,
    Sons of the morning. For your nobler part,
    Ere disencumbered of her mortal chains,
    Doubt shall be quelled and trouble chased away;
    With only such degree of sadness left                        
    As may support longings of pure desire;
    And strengthen love, rejoicing secretly
    In the sublime attractions of the grave."

      While, in this strain, the venerable Sage
    Poured forth his aspirations, and announced                  
    His judgments, near that lonely house we paced
    A plot of green-sward, seemingly preserved
    By nature's care from wreck of scattered stones,
    And from encroachment of encircling heath:
    Small space! but, for reiterated steps,                      
    Smooth and commodious; as a stately deck
    Which to and fro the mariner is used
    To tread for pastime, talking with his mates,
    Or haply thinking of far-distant friends,
    While the ship glides before a steady breeze.                
    Stillness prevailed around us: and the voice
    That spake was capable to lift the soul
    Toward regions yet more tranquil. But, methought,
    That he, whose fixed despondency had given
    Impulse and motive to that strong discourse,                 
    Was less upraised in spirit than abashed;
    Shrinking from admonition, like a man
    Who feels that to exhort is to reproach.
    Yet not to be diverted from his aim,
    The Sage continued:--
                          "For that other loss,                  
    The loss of confidence in social man,
    By the unexpected transports of our age
    Carried so high, that every thought, which looked
    Beyond the temporal destiny of the Kind,
    To many seemed superfluous--as, no cause                     
    Could e'er for such exalted confidence
    Exist; so, none is now for fixed despair:
    The two extremes are equally disowned
    By reason: if, with sharp recoil, from one
    You have been driven far as its opposite,                    
    Between them seek the point whereon to build
    Sound expectations. So doth he advise
    Who shared at first the illusion; but was soon
    Cast from the pedestal of pride by shocks
    Which Nature gently gave, in woods and fields;               
    Nor unreproved by Providence, thus speaking
    To the inattentive children of the world:
    'Vain-glorious Generation! what new powers
    On you have been conferred? what gifts, withheld
    From your progenitors, have ye received,                     
    Fit recompense of new desert? what claim
    Are ye prepared to urge, that my decrees
    For you should undergo a sudden change;
    And the weak functions of one busy day,
    Reclaiming and extirpating, perform                          
    What all the slowly-moving years of time,
    With their united force, have left undone?
    By nature's gradual processes be taught;
    By story be confounded! Ye aspire
    Rashly, to fall once more; and that false fruit,             
    Which, to your over-weening spirits, yields
    Hope of a flight celestial, will produce
    Misery and shame. But Wisdom of her sons
    Shall not the less, though late, be justified.'

       "Such timely warning," said the Wanderer, "gave
    That visionary voice; and, at this day,
    When a Tartarean darkness overspreads
    The groaning nations; when the impious rule,
    By will or by established ordinance,
    Their own dire agents, and constrain the good                
    To acts which they abhor; though I bewail
    This triumph, yet the pity of my heart
    Prevents me not from owning, that the law,
    By which mankind now suffers, is most just.
    For by superior energies; more strict                        
    Affiance in each other; faith more firm
    In their unhallowed principles; the bad
    Have fairly earned a victory o'er the weak,
    The vacillating, inconsistent good.
    Therefore, not unconsoled, I wait--in hope                   
    To see the moment, when the righteous cause
    Shall gain defenders zealous and devout
    As they who have opposed her; in which Virtue
    Will, to her efforts, tolerate no bounds
    That are not lofty as her rights; aspiring                   
    By impulse of her own ethereal zeal.
    That spirit only can redeem mankind;
    And when that sacred spirit shall appear,
    Then shall _our_ triumph be complete as theirs.
    Yet, should this confidence prove vain, the wise             
    Have still the keeping of their proper peace;
    Are guardians of their own tranquillity.
    They act, or they recede, observe, and feel;
    'Knowing the heart of man is set to be
    The centre of this world, about the which                    
    Those revolutions of disturbances
    Still roll; where all the aspècts of misery
    Predominate; whose strong effects are such
    As he must bear, being powerless to redress;
    _And that unless above himself he can                        
    Erect himself, how poor a thing is Man_!'

      "Happy is he who lives to understand,
    Not human nature only, but explores
    All natures,--to the end that he may find
    The law that governs each; and where begins                  
    The union, the partition where, that makes
    Kind and degree, among all visible Beings;
    The constitutions, powers, and faculties,
    Which they inherit,--cannot step beyond,--
    And cannot fall beneath; that do assign                      
    To every class its station and its office,
    Through all the mighty commonwealth of things
    Up from the creeping plant to sovereign Man.
    Such converse, if directed by a meek,
    Sincere, and humble spirit, teaches love:                    
    For knowledge is delight; and such delight
    Breeds love: yet, suited as it rather is
    To thought and to the climbing intellect,
    It teaches less to love, than to adore;
    If that be not indeed the highest love!"                     

      "Yet," said I, tempted here to interpose,
    "The dignity of life is not impaired
    By aught that innocently satisfies
    The humbler cravings of the heart; and he
    Is a still happier man, who, for those heights               
    Of speculation not unfit, descends;
    And such benign affections cultivates
    Among the inferior kinds; not merely those
    That he may call his own, and which depend,
    As individual objects of regard,                             
    Upon his care, from whom he also looks
    For signs and tokens of a mutual bond;
    But others, far beyond this narrow sphere,
    Whom, for the very sake of love, he loves.
    Nor is it a mean praise of rural life                        
    And solitude, that they do favour most,
    Most frequently call forth, and best sustain,
    These pure sensations; that can penetrate
    The obstreperous city; on the barren seas
    Are not unfelt; and much might recommend,                    
    How much they might inspirit and endear,
    The loneliness of this sublime retreat!"

      "Yes," said the Sage, resuming the discourse
    Again directed to his downcast Friend,
    "If, with the froward will and grovelling soul               
    Of man, offended, liberty is here,
    And invitation every hour renewed,
    To mark _their_ placid state, who never heard
    Of a command which they have power to break,
    Or rule which they are tempted to transgress:                
    These, with a soothed or elevated heart,
    May we behold; their knowledge register;
    Observe their ways; and, free from envy, find
    Complacence there:--but wherefore this to you?
    I guess that, welcome to your lonely hearth,                 
    The redbreast, ruffled up by winter's cold
    Into a 'feathery bunch,' feeds at your hand:
    A box, perchance, is from your casement hung
    For the small wren to build in;--not in vain,
    The barriers disregarding that surround                      
    This deep abiding place, before your sight
    Mounts on the breeze the butterfly; and soars,
    Small creature as she is, from earth's bright flowers,
    Into the dewy clouds. Ambition reigns
    In the waste wilderness: the Soul ascends                    
    Drawn towards her native firmament of heaven,
    When the fresh eagle, in the month of May,
    Upborne, at evening, on replenished wing,
    This shaded valley leaves; and leaves the dark
    Empurpled hills, conspicuously renewing                      
    A proud communication with the sun
    Low sunk beneath the horizon!--List!--I heard,
    From yon huge breast of rock, a voice sent forth
    As if the visible mountain made the cry.
    Again!"--The effect upon the soul was such                   
    As he expressed: from out the mountain's heart
    The solemn voice appeared to issue, startling
    The blank air--for the region all around
    Stood empty of all shape of life, and silent
    Save for that single cry, the unanswer'd bleat               
    Of a poor lamb--left somewhere to itself,
    The plaintive spirit of the solitude!
    He paused, as if unwilling to proceed,
    Through consciousness that silence in such place
    Was best, the most affecting eloquence.                      
    But soon his thoughts returned upon themselves,
    And, in soft tone of speech, thus he resumed.

      "Ah! if the heart, too confidently raised,
    Perchance too lightly occupied, or lulled
    Too easily, despise or overlook                              
    The vassalage that binds her to the earth,
    Her sad dependence upon time, and all
    The trepidations of mortality,
    What place so destitute and void--but there
    The little flower her vanity shall check;                    
    The trailing worm reprove her thoughtless pride?

      "These craggy regions, these chaotic wilds,
    Does that benignity pervade, that warms
    The mole contented with her darksome walk
    In the cold ground; and to the emmet gives                   
    Her foresight, and intelligence that makes
    The tiny creatures strong by social league;
    Supports the generations, multiplies
    Their tribes, till we behold a spacious plain
    Or grassy bottom, all, with little hills--                   
    Their labour, covered, as a lake with waves;
    Thousands of cities, in the desert place
    Built up of life, and food, and means of life!
    Nor wanting here, to entertain the thought,
    Creatures that in communities exist,                         
    Less, as might seem, for general guardianship
    Or through dependence upon mutual aid,
    Than by participation of delight
    And a strict love of fellowship, combined.
    What other spirit can it be that prompts                     
    The gilded summer flies to mix and weave
    Their sports together in the solar beam,
    Or in the gloom of twilight hum their joy?
    More obviously the self-same influence rules                 
    The feathered kinds; the fieldfare's pensive flock,
    The cawing rooks, and sea-mews from afar,
    Hovering above these inland solitudes,
    By the rough wind unscattered, at whose call
    Up through the trenches of the long-drawn vales
    Their voyage was begun: nor is its power                
    Unfelt among the sedentary fowl
    That seek yon pool, and there prolong their stay
    In silent congress; or together roused
    Take flight; while with their clang the air resounds.
    And, over all, in that ethereal vault,
    Is the mute company of changeful clouds;
    Bright apparition, suddenly put forth,
    The rainbow smiling on the faded storm;
    The mild assemblage of the starry heavens;
    And the great sun, earth's universal lord!                   

      "How bountiful is Nature! he shall find
    Who seeks not; and to him, who hath not asked,
    Large measure shall be dealt. Three sabbath-days
    Are scarcely told, since, on a service bent
    Of mere humanity, you clomb those heights;                   
    And what a marvellous and heavenly show
    Was suddenly revealed!--the swains moved on,
    And heeded not: you lingered, you perceived
    And felt, deeply as living man could feel.
    There is a luxury in self-dispraise;                    
    And inward self-disparagement affords
    To meditative spleen a grateful feast.
    Trust me, pronouncing on your own desert,
    You judge unthankfully: distempered nerves
    Infect the thoughts: the languor of the frame                
    Depresses the soul's vigour. Quit your couch--
    Cleave not so fondly to your moody cell;
    Nor let the hallowed powers, that shed from heaven
    Stillness and rest, with disapproving eye
    Look down upon your taper, through a watch                   
    Of midnight hours, unseasonably twinkling
    In this deep Hollow, like a sullen star
    Dimly reflected in a lonely pool.
    Take courage, and withdraw yourself from ways
    That run not parallel to nature's course.                    
    Rise with the lark! your matins shall obtain
    Grace, be their composition what it may,
    If but with hers performed; climb once again,
    Climb every day, those ramparts; meet the breeze
    Upon their tops, adventurous as a bee                        
    That from your garden thither soars, to feed
    On new-blown heath; let yon commanding rock
    Be your frequented watch-tower; roll the stone
    In thunder down the mountains; with all your might
    Chase the wild goat; and if the bold red deer                
    Fly to those harbours, driven by hound and horn
    Loud echoing, add your speed to the pursuit;
    So, wearied to your hut shall you return,
    And sink at evening into sound repose."

      The Solitary lifted toward the hills                  
    A kindling eye:--accordant feelings rushed
    Into my bosom, whence these words broke forth:
    "Oh! what a joy it were, in vigorous health,
    To have a body (this our vital frame
    With shrinking sensibility endued,                           
    And all the nice regards of flesh and blood)
    And to the elements surrender it
    As if it were a spirit!--How divine,
    The liberty, for frail, for mortal, man
    To roam at large among unpeopled glens                       
    And mountainous retirements, only trod
    By devious footsteps; regions consecrate
    To oldest time! and, reckless of the storm
    That keeps the raven quiet in her nest,
    Be as a presence or a motion--one                            
    Among the many there; and while the mists
    Flying, and rainy vapours, call out shapes
    And phantoms from the crags and solid earth
    As fast as a musician scatters sounds
    Out of an instrument; and while the streams                  
    (As at a first creation and in haste
    To exercise their untried faculties)
    Descending from the region of the clouds,
    And starting from the hollows of the earth
    More multitudinous every moment, rend                        
    Their way before them--what a joy to roam
    An equal among mightiest energies;
    And haply sometimes with articulate voice,
    Amid the deafening tumult, scarcely heard
    By him that utters it, exclaim aloud,                        
    'Rage on ye elements! let moon and stars
    Their aspects lend, and mingle in their turn
    With this commotion (ruinous though it be)
    From day to night, from night to day, prolonged!'"

      "Yes," said the Wanderer, taking from my lips              
    The strain of transport, "whosoe'er in youth
    Has, through ambition of his soul, given way
    To such desires, and grasped at such delight,
    Shall feel congenial stirrings late and long,
    In spite of all the weakness that life brings,               
    Its cares and sorrows; he, though taught to own
    The tranquillizing power of time, shall wake,
    Wake sometimes to a noble restlessness--
    Loving the sports which once he gloried in.

      "Compatriot, Friend, remote are Garry's hills,             
    The streams far distant of your native glen;
    Yet is their form and image here expressed
    With brotherly resemblance. Turn your steps
    Wherever fancy leads; by day, by night,
    Are various engines working, not the same                    
    As those with which your soul in youth was moved,
    But by the great Artificer endowed
    With no inferior power. You dwell alone;
    You walk, you live, you speculate alone;
    Yet doth remembrance, like a sovereign prince,               
    For you a stately gallery maintain
    Of gay or tragic pictures. You have seen,
    Have acted, suffered, travelled far, observed
    With no incurious eye; and books are yours,
    Within whose silent chambers treasure lies                   
    Preserved from age to age; more precious far
    Than that accumulated store of gold
    And orient gems, which, for a day of need,
    The Sultan hides deep in ancestral tombs.
    These hoards of truth you can unlock at will:                
    And music waits upon your skilful touch,
    Sounds which the wandering shepherd from these heights
    Hears, and forgets his purpose;--furnished thus,
    How can you droop, if willing to be upraised? 

      "A piteous lot it were to flee from Man--                  
    Yet not rejoice in Nature. He, whose hours
    Are by domestic pleasures uncaressed
    And unenlivened; who exists whole years
    Apart from benefits received or done
    'Mid the transactions of the bustling crowd;                 
    Who neither hears, nor feels a wish to hear,
    Of the world's interests--such a one hath need
    Of a quick fancy and an active heart,
    That, for the day's consumption, books may yield
    Food not unwholesome; earth and air correct                  
    His morbid humour, with delight supplied
    Or solace, varying as the seasons change.
    --Truth has her pleasure-grounds, her haunts of ease
    And easy contemplation; gay parterres,
    And labyrinthine walks, her sunny glades                     
    And shady groves in studied contrast--each,
    For recreation, leading into each:
    These may he range, if willing to partake
    Their soft indulgences, and in due time
    May issue thence, recruited for the tasks                    
    And course of service Truth requires from those
    Who tend her altars, wait upon her throne,
    And guard her fortresses. Who thinks, and feels,
    And recognises ever and anon
    The breeze of nature stirring in his soul,                   
    Why need such man go desperately astray,
    And nurse 'the dreadful appetite of death?'
    If tired with systems, each in its degree
    Substantial, and all crumbling in their turn,
    Let him build systems of his own, and smile                  
    At the fond work, demolished with a touch;
    If unreligious, let him be at once,
    Among ten thousand innocents, enrolled
    A pupil in the many-chambered school,
    Where superstition weaves her airy dreams.                   

      "Life's autumn past, I stand on winter's verge;
    And daily lose what I desire to keep:
    Yet rather would I instantly decline
    To the traditionary sympathies
    Of a most rustic ignorance, and take                         
    A fearful apprehension from the owl
    Or death-watch: and as readily rejoice,
    If two auspicious magpies crossed my way;--
    To this would rather bend than see and hear
    The repetitions wearisome of sense,                          
    Where soul is dead, and feeling hath no place;
    Where knowledge, ill begun in cold remark
    On outward things, with formal inference ends;
    Or, if the mind turn inward, she recoils
    At once--or, not recoiling, is perplexed--                   
    Lost in a gloom of uninspired research;
    Meanwhile, the heart within the heart, the seat
    Where peace and happy consciousness should dwell,
    On its own axis restlessly revolving,
    Seeks, yet can nowhere find, the light of truth.

      "Upon the breast of new-created earth
    Man walked; and when and wheresoe'er he moved,
    Alone or mated, solitude was not.
    He heard, borne on the wind, the articulate voice
    Of God; and Angels to his sight appeared                 
    Crowning the glorious hills of paradise;
    Or through the groves gliding like morning mist
    Enkindled by the sun. He sate--and talked
    With winged Messengers; who daily brought
    To his small island in the ethereal deep                     
    Tidings of joy and love.--From those pure heights
    (Whether of actual vision, sensible
    To sight and feeling, or that in this sort
    Have condescendingly been shadowed forth
    Communications spiritually maintained,                       
    And intuitions moral and divine)
    Fell Human-kind--to banishment condemned
    That flowing years repealed not: and distress
    And grief spread wide; but Man escaped the doom
    Of destitution;--solitude was not.                           
    --Jehovah--shapeless Power above all Powers,
    Single and one, the omnipresent God,
    By vocal utterance, or blaze of light,
    Or cloud of darkness, localised in heaven;
    On earth, enshrined within the wandering ark;
    Or, out of Sion, thundering from his throne
    Between the Cherubim--on the chosen Race
    Showered miracles, and ceased not to dispense
    Judgments, that filled the land from age to age
    With hope, and love, and gratitude, and fear
    And with amazement smote;--thereby to assert
    His scorned, or unacknowledged, sovereignty.
    And when the One, ineffable of name,
    Of  nature indivisible, withdrew
    From mortal adoration or regard,                             
    Not then was Deity engulfed; nor Man,
    The rational creature, left, to feel the weight
    Of his own reason, without sense or thought
    Of higher reason and a purer will,
    To benefit and bless, through mightier power:--              
    Whether the Persian--zealous to reject
    Altar and image, and the inclusive walls
    And roofs of temples built by human hands--
    To loftiest heights ascending, from their tops,
    With myrtle-wreathed tiara on his brow,
    Presented sacrifice to moon and stars,
    And to the winds and mother elements,
    And the whole circle of the heavens, for him
    A sensitive existence, and a God,
    With lifted hands invoked, and songs of praise:              
    Or, less reluctantly to bonds of sense
    Yielding his soul, the Babylonian framed
    For influence undefined a personal shape;
    And, from the plain, with toil immense, upreared
    Tower eight times planted on the top of tower,               
    That Belus, nightly to his splendid couch
    Descending, there might rest; upon that height
    Pure and serene, diffused--to overlook
    Winding Euphrates, and the city vast
    Of his devoted worshippers, far-stretched,                   
    With grove and field and garden interspersed;
    Their town, and foodful region for support
    Against the pressure of beleaguering war.

      "Chaldean Shepherds, ranging trackless fields,
    Beneath the concave of unclouded skies                       
    Spread like a sea, in boundless solitude,
    Looked on the polar star, as on a guide
    And guardian of their course, that never closed
    His stedfast eye. The planetary Five
    With a submissive reverence they beheld;                     
    Watched, from the centre of their sleeping flocks,
    Those radiant Mercuries, that seemed to move
    Carrying through ether, in perpetual round,
    Decrees and resolutions of the Gods;
    And, by their aspects, signifying works                      
    Of dim futurity, to Man revealed.
    --The imaginative faculty was lord
    Of observations natural; and, thus
    Led on, those shepherds made report of stars
    In set rotation passing to and fro,                          
    Between the orbs of our apparent sphere
    And its invisible counterpart, adorned
    With answering constellations, under earth,
    Removed from all approach of living sight
    But present to the dead; who, so they deemed,                
    Like those celestial messengers beheld
    All accidents, and judges were of all.

      "The lively Grecian, in a land of hills,
    Rivers and fertile plains, and sounding shores,--
    Under a cope of sky more variable,
    Could find commodious place for every God,
    Promptly received, as prodigally brought,
    From the surrounding countries, at the choice
    Of all adventurers. With unrivalled skill,
    As nicest observation furnished hints                        
    For studious fancy, his quick hand bestowed
    On fluent operations a fixed shape;
    Metal or stone, idolatrously served.
    And yet--triumphant o'er this pompous show
    Of art, this palpable array of sense,                        
    On every side encountered; in despite
    Of the gross fictions chanted in the streets
    By wandering Rhapsodists; and in contempt
    Of doubt and bold denial hourly urged
    Amid the wrangling schools--a SPIRIT hung,                   
    Beautiful region! o'er thy towns and farms,
    Statues and temples, and memorial tombs;
    And emanations were perceived; and acts
    Of immortality, in Nature's course,
    Exemplified by mysteries, that were felt                     
    As bonds, on grave philosopher imposed
    And armed warrior; and in every grove
    A gay or pensive tenderness prevailed,
    When piety more awful had relaxed.                           
    --'Take, running river, take these locks of mine'--
    Thus would the Votary say--'this severed hair,
    'My vow fulfilling, do I here present,
    'Thankful for my beloved child's return.
    'Thy banks, Cephisus, he again hath trod,
    'Thy murmurs heard; and drunk the crystal lymph
    'With which thou dost refresh the thirsty lip,
    'And, all day long, moisten these flowery fields!'
    And, doubtless, sometimes, when the hair was shed
    Upon the flowing stream, a thought arose
    Of Life continuous, Being unimpaired;                        
    That hath been, is, and where it was and is
    There shall endure,--existence unexposed
    To the blind walk of mortal accident;
    From diminution safe and weakening age;
    While man grows old, and dwindles, and decays;               
    And countless generations of mankind
    Depart; and leave no vestige where they trod.

      "We live by Admiration, Hope, and Love;
    And, even as these are well and wisely fixed,
    In dignity of being we ascend.                               
    But what is error?"--"Answer he who can!"
    The Sceptic somewhat haughtily exclaimed:
    "Love, Hope, and Admiration--are they not
    Mad Fancy's favourite vassals? Does not life
    Use them, full oft, as pioneers to ruin,                     
    Guides to destruction? Is it well to trust
    Imagination's light when reason's fails,
    The unguarded taper where the guarded faints?
    --Stoop from those heights, and soberly declare
    What error is; and, of our errors, which                     
    Doth most debase the mind; the genuine seats
    Of power, where are they? Who shall regulate,
    With truth, the scale of intellectual rank?"

      "Methinks," persuasively the Sage replied,
    "That for this arduous office you possess                    
    Some rare advantages. Your early days
    A grateful recollection must supply
    Of much exalted good by Heaven vouchsafed
    To dignify the humblest state.--Your voice
    Hath, in my hearing, often testified                         
    That poor men's children, they, and they alone,
    By their condition taught, can understand
    The wisdom of the prayer that daily asks
    For daily bread. A consciousness is yours
    How feelingly religion may be learned                        
    In smoky cabins, from a mother's tongue--
    Heard while the dwelling vibrates to the din
    Of the contiguous torrent, gathering strength
    At every moment--and, with strength, increase
    Of fury; or, while snow is at the door,                      
    Assaulting and defending, and the wind,
    A sightless labourer, whistles at his work--
    Fearful; but resignation tempers fear,
    And piety is sweet to infant minds.                          
    --The Shepherd-lad, that in the sunshine carves,
    On the green turf, a dial to divide
    The silent hours; and who to that report
    Can portion out his pleasures, and adapt,
    Throughout a long and lonely summer's day
    His round of pastoral duties, is not left               
    With less intelligence for _moral_ things
    Of gravest import. Early he perceives,
    Within himself, a measure and a rule,
    Which to the sun of truth he can apply,
    That shines for him, and shines for all mankind.             
    Experience daily fixing his regards
    On nature's wants, he knows how few they are,
    And where they lie, how answered and appeased.
    This knowledge ample recompense affords
    For manifold privations; he refers                           
    His notions to this standard; on this rock
    Rests his desires; and hence, in after life,
    Soul-strengthening patience, and sublime content.
    Imagination--not permitted here
    To waste her powers, as in the worldling's mind,             
    On fickle pleasures, and superfluous cares,
    And trivial ostentation--is left free
    And puissant to range the solemn walks
    Of time and nature, girded by a zone
    That, while it binds, invigorates and supports.              
    Acknowledge, then, that whether by the side
    Of his poor hut, or on the mountain top,
    Or in the cultured field, a Man so bred
    (Take from him what you will upon the score
    Of ignorance or illusion) lives and breathes                 
    For noble purposes of mind: his heart
    Beats to the heroic song of ancient days;
    His eye distinguishes, his soul creates,
    And those illusions, which excite the scorn
    Or move the pity of unthinking minds,                        
    Are they not mainly outward ministers
    Of inward conscience? with whose service charged
    They came and go, appeared and disappear,
    Diverting evil purposes, remorse
    Awakening, chastening an intemperate grief,                  
    Or pride of heart abating: and, whene'er
    For less important ends those phantoms move,
    Who would forbid them, if their presence serve,
    On thinly-peopled mountains and wild heaths,
    Filling a space, else vacant, to exalt                       
    The forms of Nature, and enlarge her powers?

      "Once more to distant ages of the world
    Let us revert, and place before our thoughts
    The face which rural solitude might wear
    To the unenlightened swains of pagan Greece.
    --In that fair clime, the lonely herdsman, stretched
    On the soft grass through half a summer's day,
    With music lulled his indolent repose:
    And, in some fit of weariness, if he,
    When his own breath was silent, chanced to hear             
    A distant strain, far sweeter than the sounds
    Which his poor skill could make, his fancy fetched,
    Even from the blazing chariot of the sun,
    A beardless Youth, who touched a golden lute,
    And filled the illumined groves with ravishment.             
    The nightly hunter, lifting a bright eye
    Up towards the crescent moon, with grateful heart
    Called on the lovely wanderer who bestowed
    That timely light, to share his joyous sport:
    And hence, a beaming Goddess with her Nymphs,
    Across the lawn and through the darksome grove,
    Not unaccompanied with tuneful notes
    By echo multiplied from rock or cave,
    Swept in the storm of chase; as moon and stars
    Glance rapidly along the clouded heaven,
    When winds are blowing strong. The traveller slaked
    His thirst from rill or gushing fount, and thanked
    The Naiad. Sunbeams, upon distant hills
    Gliding apace, with shadows in their train,
    Might, with small help from fancy, be transformed            
    Into fleet Oreads sporting visibly.
    The Zephyrs fanning, as they passed, their wings,
    Lacked not, for love, fair objects whom they wooed
    With gentle whisper. Withered boughs grotesque,
    Stripped of their leaves and twigs by hoary age,             
    From depth of shaggy covert peeping forth
    In the low vale, or on steep mountain side;
    And, sometimes, intermixed with stirring horns
    Of the live deer, or goat's depending beard,--
    These were the lurking Satyrs, a wild brood              
    Of gamesome Deities; or Pan himself,
    The simple shepherd's awe-inspiring God!"

      The strain was aptly chosen; and I could mark
    Its kindly influence, o'er the yielding brow
    Of our Companion, gradually diffused;                        
    While, listening, he had paced the noiseless turf,
    Like one whose untired ear a murmuring stream
    Detains; but tempted now to interpose,
    He with a smile exclaimed:--

                                "'Tis well you speak
    At a safe distance from our native land,                     
    And from the mansions where our youth was taught.
    The true descendants of those godly men
    Who swept from Scotland, in a flame of zeal,
    Shrine, altar, image, and the massy piles
    That harboured them,--the souls retaining yet                
    The churlish features of that after-race
    Who fled to woods, caverns, and jutting rocks,
    In deadly scorn of superstitious rites,
    Or what their scruples construed to be such--
    How, think you, would they tolerate this scheme              
    Of fine propensities, that tends, if urged
    Far as it might be urged, to sow afresh
    The weeds of Romish phantasy, in vain
    Uprooted; would re-consecrate our wells
    To good Saint Fillan and to fair Saint Anne;             
    And from long banishment recal Saint Giles,
    To watch again with tutelary love
    O'er stately Edinborough throned on crags?
    A blessed restoration,to behold
    The patron, on the shoulders of his priests,                 
    Once more parading through her crowded streets
    Now simply guarded by the sober powers
    Of science, and philosophy, and sense!"

      This answer followed.--"You have turned my thoughts
    Upon our brave Progenitors, who rose                         
    Against idolatry with warlike mind,
    And shrunk from vain observances, to lurk
    In woods, and dwell under impending rocks
    Ill-sheltered, and oft wanting fire and food;
    Why?--for this very reason that they felt,                   
    And did acknowledge, wheresoe'er they moved,
    A spiritual presence, oft-times misconceived,
    But still a high dependence, a divine
    Bounty and government, that filled their hearts
    With joy, and gratitude, and fear, and love;                 
    And from their fervent lips drew hymns of praise,
    That through the desert rang.Though favoured less,
    Far less, than these, yet such, in their degree,
    Were those bewildered Pagans of old time.
    Beyond their own poor natures and above                      
    They looked; were humbly thankful for the good
    Which the warm sun solicited, and earth
    Bestowed; were gladsome,--and their moral sense
    They fortified with reverence for the Gods;
    And they had hopes that overstepped the Grave.               

      "Now, shall our great Discoverers," he exclaimed,
    Raising his voice triumphantly, "obtain
    From sense and reason less than these obtained,
    Though far misled? Shall men for whom our age
    Unbaffled powers of vision hath prepared,                    
    To explore the world without and world within,
    Be joyless as the blind? Ambitious spirits--
    Whom earth, at this late season, hath produced
    To regulate the moving spheres, and weigh
    The planets in the hollow of their hand;                     
    And they who rather dive than soar, whose pains
    Have solved the elements, or analysed
    The thinking principle--shall they in fact
    Prove a degraded Race? and what avails
    Renown, if their presumption make them such?                 
    Oh! there is laughter at their work in heaven!
    Inquire of ancient Wisdom; go, demand
    Of mighty Nature, if 'twas ever meant
    That we should pry far off yet be unraised;
    That we should pore, and dwindle as we pore,                 
    Viewing all objects unremittingly
    In disconnexion dead and spiritless;
    And still dividing, and dividing still,
    Break down all grandeur, still unsatisfied
    With the perverse attempt, while littleness                  
    May yet become more little; waging thus
    An impious warfare with the very life
    Of our own souls!
                      "And if indeed there be
    An all-pervading Spirit, upon whom
    Our dark foundations rest, could he design                   
    That this magnificent effect of power,
    The earth we tread, the sky that we behold
    By day, and all the pomp which night reveals;
    That these--and that superior mystery
    Our vital frame, so fearfully devised,                       
    And the dread soul within it--should exist
    Only to be examined, pondered, searched,
    Probed, vexed, and criticised? Accuse me not
    Of arrogance, unknown Wanderer as I am,
    If, having walked with Nature threescore years,              
    And offered, far as frailty would allow,
    My heart a daily sacrifice to Truth,
    I now affirm of Nature and of Truth,
    Whom I have served, that their DIVINITY
    Revolts, offended at the ways of men                         
    Swayed by such motives, to such ends employed;
    Philosophers, who, though the human soul
    Be of a thousand faculties composed,
    And twice ten thousand interests, do yet prize
    This soul, and the transcendent universe,                    
    No more than as a mirror that reflects
    To proud Self-love her own intelligence;
    That one, poor, finite object, in the abyss
    Of infinite Being, twinkling restlessly!

      "Nor higher place can be assigned to him                   
    And his compeers--the laughing Sage of France.--
    Crowned was he, if my memory do not err,
    With laurel planted upon hoary hairs,
    In sign of conquest by his wit achieved
    And benefits his wisdom had conferred;                      
    His stooping body tottered with wreaths of flowers
    Opprest, far less becoming ornaments
    Than Spring oft twines about a mouldering tree;
    Yet so it pleased a fond, a vain, old Man,
    And a most frivolous people. Him I mean                     
    Who penned,to ridicule confiding faith,
    This sorry Legend; which by chance we found
    Piled in a nook, through malice, as might seem,
    Among more innocent rubbish."--Speaking thus,
    With a brief notice when, and how, and where,               
    We had espied the book, he drew it forth;
    And courteously, as if the act removed,
    At once, all traces from the good Man's heart
    Of unbenign aversion or contempt,
    Restored it to its owner. "Gentle Friend,"                  
    Herewith he grasped the Solitary's hand,
    "You have known lights and guides better than these.
    Ah! let not aught amiss within dispose
    A noble mind to practise on herself,
    And tempt opinion to support the wrongs                     
    Of passion: whatsoe'er be felt or feared,
    From higher judgment-seats make no appeal
    To lower: can you question that the soul
    Inherits an allegiance, not by choice
    To be cast off, upon an oath proposed                       
    By each new upstart notion? In the ports
    Of levity no refuge can be found,
    No shelter, for a spirit in distress.
    He, who by wilful disesteem of life
    And proud insensibility to hope,                            
    Affronts the eye of Solitude, shall learn
    That her mild nature can be terrible;
    That neither she nor Silence lack the power
    To avenge their own insulted majesty.

      "O blest seclusion! when the mind admits                  
    The law of duty; and can therefore move
    Through each vicissitude of loss and gain,
    Linked in entire complacence with her choice;
    When youth's presumptuousness is mellowed down,
    And manhood's vain anxiety dismissed;                       
    When wisdom shows her seasonable fruit,
    Upon the boughs of sheltering leisure hung
    In sober plenty; when the spirit stoops
    To drink with gratitude the crystal stream
    Of unreproved enjoyment; and is pleased                     
    To muse, and be saluted by the air
    Of meek repentance, wafting wall-flower scents
    From out the crumbling ruins of fallen pride
    And chambers of transgression, now forlorn.
    O, calm contented days, and peaceful nights!                
    Who, when such good can be obtained, would strive
    To reconcile his manhood to a couch
    Soft, as may seem, but, under that disguise,
    Stuffed with the thorny substance of the past
    For fixed annoyance; and full oft beset                     
    With floating dreams, black and disconsolate,
    The vapoury phantoms of futurity?

      "Within the soul a faculty abides,
    That with interpositions, which would hide
    And darken, so can deal that they become                    
    Contingencies of pomp; and serve to exalt
    Her native brightness. As the ample moon,
    In the deep stillness of a summer even
    Rising behind a thick and lofty grove,
    Burns, like an unconsuming fire of light,                   
    In the green trees; and, kindling on all sides
    Their leafy umbrage, turns the dusky veil
    Into a substance glorious as her own,
    Yea, with her own incorporated, by power
    Capacious and serene. Like power abides                     
    In man's celestial spirit; virtue thus
    Sets forth and magnifies herself; thus feeds
    A calm, a beautiful, and silent fire,
    From the encumbrances of mortal life,
    From error, disappointment--nay, from guilt;                
    And sometimes, so relenting justice wills,
    From palpable oppressions of despair."

      The Solitary by these words was touched
    With manifest emotion, and exclaimed;
    "But how begin? and whence?--'The Mind is free--
    Resolve,' the haughty Moralist would say,                   
    'This single act is all that we demand.'
    Alas! such wisdom bids a creature fly
    Whose very sorrow is, that time hath shorn
    His natural wings!--To friendship let him turn              
    For succour; but perhaps he sits alone
    On stormy waters, tossed in a little boat
    That holds but him, and can contain no more!
    Religion tells of amity sublime
    Which no condition can preclude; of One                     
    Who sees all suffering, comprehends all wants,
    All weakness fathoms, can supply all needs:
    But is that bounty absolute?--His gifts,
    Are they not, still, in some degree, rewards
    For acts of service? Can his love extend                    
    To hearts that own not him? Will showers of grace,
    When in the sky no promise may be seen,
    Fall to refresh a parched and withered land?
    Or shall the groaning Spirit cast her load
    At the Redeemer's feet?"
                              In rueful tone,                   
    With some impatience in his mien, he spake:
    Back to my mind rushed all that had been urged
    To calm the Sufferer when his story closed;
    I looked for counsel as unbending now;
    But a discriminating sympathy                               
    Stooped to this apt reply:--
                                    "As men from men
    Do, in the constitution of their souls,
    Differ, by mystery not to be explained;
    And as we fall by various ways, and sink
    One deeper than another, self-condemned,                    
    Through manifold degrees of guilt and shame;
    So manifold and various are the ways
    Of restoration, fashioned to the steps
    Of all infirmity, and tending all
    To the same point, attainable by all--                      
    Peace in ourselves, and union with our God.
    For you, assuredly, a hopeful road
    Lies open: we have heard from you a voice
    At every moment softened in its course
    By tenderness of heart; have seen your eye,                 
    Even like an altar lit by fire from heaven,
    Kindle before us.--Your discourse this day,
    That, like the fabled Lethe, wished to flow
    In creeping sadness, through oblivious shades
    Of death and night, has caught at every turn                
    The colours of the sun. Access for you
    Is yet preserved to principles of truth,
    Which the imaginative Will upholds
    In seats of wisdom, not to be approached
    By the inferior Faculty that moulds,                        
    With her minute and speculative pains,
    Opinion, ever changing!
                             "I have seen
    A curious child, who dwelt upon a tract
    Of inland ground, applying to his ear
    The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell;                  
    To which, in silence hushed, his very soul
    Listened intensely; and his countenance soon
    Brightened with joy; for from within were heard
    Murmurings, whereby the monitor expressed
    Mysterious union with its native sea.                       
    Even such a shell the universe itself
    Is to the ear of Faith; and there are times,
    I doubt not, when to you it doth impart
    Authentic tidings of invisible things;
    Of ebb and flow, and ever-during power;                     
    And central peace, subsisting at the heart
    Of endless agitation. Here you stand,
    Adore, and worship, when you know it not;
    Pious beyond the intention of your thought;
    Devout above the meaning of your will.                      
    --Yes, you have felt, and may not cease to feel.
    The estate of man would be indeed forlorn
    If false conclusions of the reasoning power
    Made the eye blind, and closed the passages                 
    Through which the ear converses with the heart.
    Has not the soul, the being of your life,
    Received a shock of awful consciousness,
    In some calm season, when these lofty rocks
    At night's approach bring down the unclouded sky,
    To rest upon their circumambient walls;                     
    A temple framing of dimensions vast,
    And yet not too enormous for the sound
    Of human anthems,--choral song, or burst
    Sublime of instrumental harmony,
    To glorify the Eternal! What if these                       
    Did never break the stillness that prevails
    Here,--if the solemn nightingale be mute,
    And the soft woodlark here did never chant
    Her vespers, Nature fails not to provide
    Impulse and utterance. The whispering air                   
    Sends inspiration from the shadowy heights,
    And blind recesses of the caverned rocks;
    The little rills, and waters numberless,
    Inaudible by daylight, blend their notes
    With the loud streams: and often, at the hour               
    When issue forth the first pale stars, is heard,
    Within the circuit of this fabric huge,
    One voice--the solitary raven, flying
    Athwart the concave of the dark blue dome,
    Unseen, perchance above all power of sight--           
    An iron knell! with echoes from afar
    Faint--and still fainter--as the cry, with which
    The wanderer accompanies her flight
    Through the calm region, fades upon the ear,
    Diminishing by distance till it seemed                      
    To expire; yet from the abyss is caught again,
    And yet again recovered!
                                "But descending
    From these imaginative heights, that yield
    Far-stretching views into eternity,
    Acknowledge that to Nature's humbler power                  
    Your cherished sullenness is forced to bend
    Even here, where her amenities are sown
    With sparing hand. Then trust yourself abroad
    To range her blooming bowers, and spacious fields,
    Where on the labours of the happy throng                    
    She smiles, including in her wide embrace
    City, and town, and tower,--and sea with ships
    Sprinkled;--be our Companion while we track
    Her rivers populous with gliding life;                      
    While, free as air, o'er printless sands we march,
    Or pierce the gloom of her majestic woods;
    Roaming, or resting under grateful shade
    In peace and meditative cheerfulness;
    Where living things, and things inanimate,                  
    Do speak, at Heaven's command, to eye and ear,
    And speak to social reason's inner sense,
    With inarticulate language.
                                "For, the Man--
    Who, in this spirit, communes with the Forms
    Of nature, who with understanding heart
    Both knows and loves such objects as excite            
    No morbid passions, no disquietude,
    No vengeance, and no hatred--needs must feel
    The joy of that pure principle of love
    So deeply, that, unsatisfied with aught
    Less pure and exquisite, he cannot choose                   
    But seek for objects of a kindred love
    In fellow-natures and a kindred joy.
    Accordingly he by degrees perceives
    His feelings of aversion softened down;
    A holy tenderness pervade his frame.                        
    His sanity of reason not impaired,
    Say rather, all his thoughts now flowing clear,
    From a clear fountain flowing, he looks round
    And seeks for good; and finds the good he seeks:
    Until abhorrence and contempt are things                    
    He only knows by name; and, if he hear,
    From other mouths, the language which they speak,
    He is compassionate; and has no thought,
    No feeling, which can overcome his love.

      "And further; by contemplating these Forms                
    In the relations which they bear to man,
    He shall discern, how, through the various means
    Which silently they yield, are multiplied
    The spiritual presences of absent things.
    Trust me, that for the instructed, time will come      
    When they shall meet no object but may teach
    Some acceptable lesson to their minds
    Of human suffering, or of human joy.
    So shall they learn, while all things speak of man,
    Their duties from all forms; and general laws,         
    And local accidents, shall tend alike
    To rouse, to urge; and, with the will, confer
    The ability to spread the blessings wide
    Of true philanthropy. The light of love
    Not failing, perseverance from their steps                  
    Departing not, for them shall be confirmed
    The glorious habit by which sense is made
    Subservient still to moral purposes,
    Auxiliar to divine. That change shall clothe
    The naked spirit, ceasing to deplore                        
    The burthen of existence. Science then
    Shall be a precious visitant; and then,
    And only then, be worthy of her name:
    For then her heart shall kindle; her dull eye,
    Dull and inanimate, no more shall hang                      
    Chained to its object in brute slavery;
    But taught with patient interest to watch
    The processes of things, and serve the cause
    Of order and distinctness, not for this
    Shall it forget that its most noble use,                    
    Its most illustrious province, must be found
    In furnishing clear guidance, a support
    Not treacherous, to the mind's _excursive_ power.
    --So build we up the Being that we are;
    Thus deeply drinking--in the soul of things,                
    We shall be wise perforce; and, while inspired
    By choice, and conscious that the Will is free,
    Shall move unswerving, even as if impelled
    By strict necessity, along the path
    Of order and of good. Whate'er we see,                      
    Or feel, shall tend to quicken and refine;
    Shall fix, in calmer seats of moral strength,
    Earthly desires; and raise, to loftier heights
    Of divine love, our intellectual soul."

      Here closed the Sage that eloquent harangue,              
    Poured forth with fervour in continuous stream,
    Such as, remote, 'mid savage wilderness,
    An Indian Chief discharges from his breast
    Into the hearing of assembled tribes,
    In open circle seated round, and hushed                     
    As the unbreathing air, when not a leaf
    Stirs in the mighty woods.--So did he speak:
    The words he uttered shall not pass away
    Dispersed, like music that the wind takes up
    By snatches, and lets fall, to be forgotten;                
    No--they sank into me, the bounteous gift
    Of one whom time and nature had made wise,
    Gracing his doctrine with authority
    Which hostile spirits silently allow;
    Of one accustomed to desires that feed                      
    On fruitage gathered from the tree of life;
    To hopes on knowledge and experience built;
    Of one in whom persuasion and belief
    Had ripened into faith, and faith become
    A passionate intuition; whence the Soul,                    
    Though bound to earth by ties of pity and love,
    From all injurious servitude was free.

      The Sun, before his place of rest were reached,
    Had yet to travel far, but unto us,
    To us who stood low in that hollow dell,                    
    He had become invisible,--a pomp
    Leaving behind of yellow radiance spread
    Over the mountain sides, in contrast bold
    With ample shadows, seemingly, no less                      
    Than those resplendent lights, his rich bequest;
    A dispensation of his evening power.
    --Adown the path that from the glen had led
    The funeral train, the Shepherd and his Mate
    Were seen descending:--forth to greet them ran
    Our little Page: the rustic pair approach;                  
    And in the Matron's countenance may be read
    Plain indication that the words, which told
    How that neglected Pensioner was sent
    Before his time into a quiet grave,
    Had done to her humanity no wrong:                          
    But we are kindly welcomed--promptly served
    With ostentatious zeal.--Along the floor
    Of the small Cottage in the lonely Dell
    A grateful couch was spread for our repose;
    Where, in the guise of mountaineers, we lay,
    Stretched upon fragrant heath, and lulled by sound
    Of far-off torrents charming the still night,
    And, to tired limbs and over-busy thoughts,
    Inviting sleep and soft forgetfulness.
