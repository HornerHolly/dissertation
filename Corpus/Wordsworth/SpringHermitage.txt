  Troubled long with warring notions
    Long impatient of thy rod,
    I resign my soul's emotions
    Unto Thee, mysterious God!

    What avails the kindly shelter                                 
    Yielded by this craggy rent,
    If my spirit toss and welter
    On the waves of discontent?

    Parching Summer hath no warrant
    To consume this crystal Well;                                 
    Rains, that make each rill a torrent,
    Neither sully it nor swell.

    Thus, dishonouring not her station,
    Would my Life present to Thee,
    Gracious God, the pure oblation                               
    Of divine tranquillity!
