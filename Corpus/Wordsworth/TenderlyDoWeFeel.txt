Tenderly do we feel by Nature’s law
    For worst offenders: though the heart will heave
    With indignation, deeply moved we grieve,
    In after thought, for Him who stood in awe
    Neither of God nor man, and only saw,                              
    Lost wretch, a horrible device enthroned
    On proud temptations, till the victim groaned
    Under the steel his hand had dared to draw.
    But O, restrain compassion, if its course,
    As oft befalls, prevent or turn aside                             
    Judgments and aims and acts whose higher source
    Is sympathy with the unforewarned, who died
    Blameless--with them that shuddered o’er his grave,
    And all who from the law firm safety crave.
