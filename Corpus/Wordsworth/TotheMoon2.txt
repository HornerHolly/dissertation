 Queen of the stars so gentle, so benign,
    That ancient Fable did to thee assign,
    When darkness creeping oer thy silver brow
    Warned thee these upper regions to forego,
    Alternate empire in the shades below                           
    A Bard, who, lately near the widespread sea
    Traversed by gleaming ships, looked up to thee
    With grateful thoughts, doth now thy rising hail
    From the close confines of a shadowy vale.
    Glory of night, conspicuous yet serene,                           
    Nor less attractive when by glimpses seen
    Through cloudy umbrage, well might that fair face,
    And all those attributes of modest grace,
    In days when Fancy wrought unchecked by fear,
    Down to the green earth fetch thee from thy sphere,               
    To sit in leafy woods by fountains clear!

      O still belovd for thine, meek Power, are charms
    That fascinate the very Babe in arms,
    While he, uplifted towards thee, laughs outright,
    Spreading his little palms in his glad Mother sight          
    O still belovd, once worshipped! Time, that frowns
    In his destructive flight on earthly crowns,
    Spares thy mild splendour; still those farshot beams
    Tremble on dancing waves and rippling streams
    With stainless touch, as chaste as when thy praise                
    Was sung by Virgin-choirs in festal lays;
    And through dark trials still dost thou explore
    Thy way for increase punctual as of yore,
    When teeming Matrons yielding to rude faith
    In mysteries of birth and life and death                          
    And painful struggle and deliverance prayed
    Of thee to visit them with lenient aid.
    What though the rites be swept away, the fanes
    Extinct that echoed to the votive strains;
    Yet thy mild aspect does not, cannot, cease                       
    Love to promote and purity and peace;
    And Fancy, unreproved, even yet may trace
    Faint types of suffering in thy beamless face.

      Then, silent Monitress! let us not blind
    To worlds unthought of till the searching mind                    
    Of Science laid them open to mankind
    Told, also, how the voiceless heavens declare
    God glory; and acknowledging thy share
    In that blest charge; let us without offence
    To aught of highest, holiest, influence                       
    Receive whatever good tis given thee to dispense.
    May sage and simple, catching with one eye
    The moral intimations of the sky,
    Learn from thy course, whereâ€™er their own be taken,
    To look on tempests, and be never shaken
    To keep with faithful step the appointed way
    Eclipsing or eclipsed, by night or day,
    And from example of thy monthly range
    Gently to brook decline and fatal change;
    Meek, patient, stedfast, and with loftier scope,                  
    Than thy revival yields, for gladsome hope!
