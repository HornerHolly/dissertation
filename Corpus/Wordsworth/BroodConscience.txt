 Ye brood of conscience Spectres! that frequent
    The bad manâ€™s restless walk, and haunt his bed--
    Fiends in your aspect, yet beneficent
    In act, as hovering Angels when they spread
    Their wings to guard the unconscious Innocent--                   
    Slow be the Statutes of the land to share
    A laxity that could not but impair
    _Your_ power to punish crime, and so prevent.
    And ye, Beliefs! coiled serpent-like about
    The adage on all tongues, Murder will out,
    How shall your ancient warnings work for good
    In the full might they hitherto have shown,
    If for deliberate shedder of man blood
    Survive not Judgment that requires his own?
