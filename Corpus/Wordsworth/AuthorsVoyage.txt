  The confidence of Youth our only Art,
    And Hope gay Pilot of the bold design,
    We saw the living Landscapes of the Rhine,
    Reach after reach, salute us and depart;
    Slow sink the Spires, and up again they start!                    
    But who shall count the Towers as they recline
    Oer the dark steeps, or in the horizon line
    Striding, with shattered crests, the eye athwart?
    More touching still, more perfect was the pleasure,
    When hurrying forward till the slackning stream                  
    Spread like a spacious Mere, we there could measure
    A smooth free course along the watery gleam,
    Think calmly on the past, and mark at leisure
    Features which else had vanished like a dream.
