   Critics right honourable Bard, decree
    Laurels to some, a nightshade wreath to thee,
    Whose muse a sure though late revenge hath taken
    Of harmless Abel death, by murdering Cain.

On Cain, a Mystery, dedicated to Sir Walter Scott

    A German Haggis from receipt
    Of him who cooked the death of Abel,
    And sent warm reeking, rich and sweet
    From Venice to Sir Walter table.
