The struggling Rill insensibly is grown
    Into a Brook of loud and stately march,
    Crossed ever and anon by plank or arch;
    And, for like use, lo! what might seem a zone
    Chosen for ornament--stone matched with stone                  
    In studied symmetry, with interspace
    For the clear waters to pursue their race
    Without restraint. How swiftly have they flown,
    Succeeding--still succeeding! Here the Child
    Puts, when the high-swoln Flood runs fierce and wild,
    His budding courage to the proof; and here                    
    Declining Manhood learns to note the sly
    And sure encroachments of infirmity,
    Thinking how fast time runs, life's end how near!
