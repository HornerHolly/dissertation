The cattle crowding round this beverage clear
    To slake their thirst, with reckless hoofs have trod
    The encircling turf into a barren clod;
    Through which the waters creep, then disappear,
    Born to be lost in Derwent flowing near;                           
    Yet, o'er the brink, and round the lime-stone cell
    Of the pure spring (they call it the "Nun's Well,"
    Name that first struck by chance my startled ear)
    A tender Spirit broods--the pensive Shade
    Of ritual honours to this Fountain paid                           
    By hooded Votaresses with saintly cheer;
    Albeit oft the Virgin-mother mild
    Looked down with pity upon eyes beguiled
    Into the shedding of "too soft a tear."
