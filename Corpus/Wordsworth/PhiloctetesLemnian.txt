When Philoctetes in the Lemnian isle
    Like a Form sculptured on a monument
    Lay couched; on him or his dread bow unbent
    Some wild Bird oft might settle and beguile
    The rigid features of a transient smile,                           
    Disperse the tear, or to the sigh give vent,
    Slackening the pains of ruthless banishment
    From his lov'd home, and from heroic toil.
    And trust that spiritual Creatures round us move,
    Griefs to allay which Reason cannot heal;                    
    Yea, veriest reptiles have sufficed to prove
    To fettered wretchedness, that no Bastile
    Is deep enough to exclude the light of love,
    Though man for brother man has ceased to feel.
