 What He--who, mid the kindred throng
    Of Heroes that inspired his song,
    Doth yet frequent the hill of storms,
    The stars dim-twinkling through their forms!
    What! Ossian here--a painted Thrall,                           
    Mute fixture on a stuccoed wall;
    To serve--an unsuspected screen
    For show that must not yet be seen;
    And, when the moment comes, to part
    And vanish by mysterious art;                                 
    Head, harp, and body, split asunder,
    For ingress to a world of wonder;
    A gay saloon, with waters dancing
    Upon the sight wherever glancing;
    One loud cascade in front, and lo!                            
    A thousand like it, white as snow--
    Streams on the walls, and torrent-foam
    As active round the hollow dome,
    Illusive cataracts! of their terrors
    Not stripped, nor voiceless in the mirrors,                   
    That catch the pageant from the flood
    Thundering adown a rocky wood.
    What pains to dazzle and confound!
    What strife of colour, shape and sound
    In this quaint medley, that might seem                        
    Devised out of a sick man's dream!
    Strange scene, fantastic and uneasy
    As ever made a maniac dizzy,
    When disenchanted from the mood
    That loves on sullen thoughts to brood!                       

    O Nature--in thy changeful visions,
    Through all thy most abrupt transitions
    Smooth, graceful, tender, or sublime--
    Ever averse to pantomime,
    Thee neither do they know nor us                             
    Thy servants, who can trifle thus;
    Else verily the sober powers
    Of rock that frowns, and stream that roars,
    Exalted by congenial sway
    Of Spirits, and the undying Lay,                              
    And Names that moulder not away,
    Had wakened some redeeming thought
    More worthy of this favoured Spot;
    Recalled some feeling--to set free
    The Bard from such indignity!                                 

    The Effigies of a valiant Wight
    I once beheld, a Templar Knight;
    Not prostrate, not like those that rest
    On tombs, with palms together prest,
    But sculptured out of living stone,                           
    And standing upright and alone,
    Both hands with rival energy
    Employed in setting his sword free
    From its dull sheath--stern sentinel
    Intent to guard St. Robert's cell;
    As if with memory of the affray
    Far distant, when, as legends say,
    The Monks of Fountain's thronged to force
    From its dear home the Hermit's corse,
    That in their keeping it might lie,                           
    To crown their abbey's sanctity.
    So had they rushed into the grot
    Of sense despised, a world forgot,
    And torn him from his loved retreat,
    Where altar-stone and rock-hewn seat                          
    Still hint that quiet best is found,
    Even by the _Living_, under ground;
    But a bold Knight, the selfish aim
    Defeating, put the Monks to shame,
    There where you see his Image stand                           
    Bare to the sky, with threatening bran
    Which lingering NID is proud to show
    Reflected in the pool below.

    Thus, like the men of earliest days,
    Our sires set forth their grateful praise:                    
    Uncouth the workmanship, and rude!
    But, nursed in mountain solitude,
    Might some aspiring artist dare
    To seize whate'er, through misty air,
    A ghost, by glimpses, may present                             
    Of imitable lineament,
    And give the phantom an array
    That less should scorn the abandoned clay;
    Then let him hew with patient stroke
    An Ossian out of mural rock,                                  
    And leave the figurative Man--
    Upon thy margin, roaring Bran!--
    Fixed, like the Templar of the steep,
    An everlasting watch to keep;
    With local sanctities in trust,                               
    More precious than a hermit's dust;
    And virtues through the mass infused,
    Which old idolatry abused.

    What though the Granite would deny
    All fervour to the sightless eye;                             
    And touch from rising suns in vain
    Solicit a Memnonian strain;
    Yet, in some fit of anger sharp,
    The wind might force the deep-grooved harp
    To utter melancholy moans                                    
    Not unconnected with the tones
    Of soul-sick flesh and weary bones;
    While grove and river notes would lend,
    Less deeply sad, with these to blend!

    Vain pleasures of luxurious life,                            
    For ever with yourselves at strife;
    Through town and country both deranged
    By affectations interchanged,
    And all the perishable gauds
    That heaven-deserted man applauds;                           
    When will your hapless patrons learn
    To watch and ponder--to discern
    The freshness, the everlasting youth,
    Of admiration sprung from truth;
    From beauty infinitely growing                               
    Upon a mind with love o'erflowing--
    To sound the depths of every Art
    That seeks its wisdom through the heart?

    Thus (where the intrusive Pile, ill-graced
    With baubles of theatric taste,                              
    O'erlooks the torrent breathing showers
    On motley bands of alien flowers
    In stiff confusion set or sown,
    Till Nature cannot find her own,
    Or keep a remnant of the sod                                 
    Which Caledonian Heroes trod)
    I mused; and, thirsting for redress,
    Recoiled into the wilderness.
