 My frame hath often trembled with delight
    When hope presented some far-distant good,
    That seemed from heaven descending, like the flood
    Of yon pure waters, from their aÃ«ry height
    Hurrying, with lordly Duddon to unite;                         
    Who, 'mid a world of images imprest
    On the calm depth of his transparent breast,
    Appears to cherish most that Torrent white,
    The fairest, softest, liveliest of them all!
    And seldom hath ear listened to a tune                        
    More lulling than the busy hum of Noon,
    Sworn by that voice--whose murmur musical
    Announces to the thirsty fields a boon
    Dewy and fresh, till showers again shall fall.
