   At early dawn, or rather when the air
    Glimmers with fading light, and shadowy Eve
    Is busiest to confer and to bereave;
    Then, pensive Votary! let thy feet repair
    To Gordale-chasm, terrific as the lair                         
    Where the young lions couch; for so, by leave
    Of the propitious hour, thou may'st perceive
    The local Deity, with oozy hair
    And mineral crown, beside his jagged urn,                      
    Recumbent: Him thou may'st behold, who hides
    His lineaments by day, yet there presides,
    Teaching the docile waters how to turn,
    Or (if need be) impediment to spurn,
    And force their passage to the salt-sea tides!
