 Men, who have ceased to reverence, soon defy
    Their forefathers; lo! sects are formed, and split
    With morbid restlessness;--the ecstatic fit
    Spreads wide; though special mysteries multiply,
    _The Saints must govern_ is their common cry;                      
    And so they labour, deeming Holy Writ
    Disgraced by aught that seems content to sit
    Beneath the roof of settled Modesty.
    The Romanist exults; fresh hope he draws
    From the confusion, craftily incites                              
    The overweening, personates the mad--
    To heap disgust upon the worthier Cause:
    Totters the Throne; the new-born Church is sad
    For every wave against her peace unites.
