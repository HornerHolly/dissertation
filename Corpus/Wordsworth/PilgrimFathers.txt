 Well worthy to be magnified are they
    Who, with sad hearts, of friends and country took
    A last farewell, their loved abodes forsook,
    And hallowed ground in which their fathers lay;
    Then to the new-found World explored their way,                    
    That so a Church, unforced, uncalled to brook
    Ritual restraints, within some sheltering nook
    Her Lord might worship and his word obey
    In freedom. Men they were who could not bend;
    Blest Pilgrims, surely, as they took for guide                    
    A will by sovereign Conscience sanctified;
    Blest while their Spirits from the woods ascend
    Along a Galaxy that knows no end,
    But in His glory who for Sinners died.
