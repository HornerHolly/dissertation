O for the help of Angels to complete
    This Temple Angels governed by a plan
    Thus far pursued (how gloriously!) by Man,
    Studious that _He_ might not disdain the seat
    Who dwells in heaven! But that aspiring heat                   
    Hath failed; and now, ye Powers! whose gorgeous wings
    And splendid aspect yon emblazonings
    But faintly picture, 'twere an office meet
    For you, on these unfinished shafts to try
    The midnight virtues of your harmony:--                       
    This vast design might tempt you to repeat
    Strains that call forth upon empyreal ground
    Immortal Fabrics, rising to the sound
    Of penetrating harps and voices sweet!
