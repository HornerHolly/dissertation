    See the Condemned alone within his cell
    And prostrate at some moment when remorse
    Stings to the quick, and, with resistless force,
    Assaults the pride she strove in vain to quell.
    Then mark him, him who could so long rebel,                        
    The crime confessed, a kneeling Penitent
    Before the Altar, where the Sacrament
    Softens his heart, till from his eyes outwell
    Tears of salvation. Welcome death! while Heaven
    Does in this change exceedingly rejoice;                          
    While yet the solemn heed the State hath given
    Helps him to meet the last Tribunalâ€™s voice
    In faith, which fresh offences, were he cast
    On old temptations, might for ever blast.
