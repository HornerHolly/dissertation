With Ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh,
    Like stars in heaven, and joyously it showed;
    Some lying fast at anchor in the road,
    Some veering up and down, one knew not why.
    A goodly Vessel did I then espy                             
    Come like a giant from a haven broad;
    And lustily along the bay she strode,
    Her tackling rich, and of apparel high.
    This Ship was nought to me, nor I to her,
    Yet I pursued her with a Lover's look;                      
    This Ship to all the rest did I prefer:
    When will she turn, and whither? She will brook
    No tarrying; where She comes the winds must stir:
    On went She, and due north her journey took.
