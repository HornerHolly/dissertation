The Sabbath bells renew the inviting peal;
    Glad music! yet there be that, worn with pain
    And sickness, listen where they long have lain,
    In sadness listen. With maternal zeal
    Inspired, the Church sends ministers to kneel                      
    Beside the afflicted; to sustain with prayer,
    And soothe the heart confession hath laid bare
    That pardon, from Gods throne, may set its seal
    On a true Penitent. When breath departs
    From one disburthened so, so comforted,                           
    His Spirit Angels greet; and ours be hope
    That, if the Sufferer rise from his sickbed,
    Hence he will gain a firmer mind, to cope
    With a bad world, and foil the Tempters arts.
