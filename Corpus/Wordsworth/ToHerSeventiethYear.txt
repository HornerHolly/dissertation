Such age how beautiful! O Lady bright,
    Whose mortal lineaments seem all refined
    By favouring Nature and a saintly Mind
    To something purer and more exquisite
    Than flesh and blood; whene'er thou meet'st my sight,
    When I behold thy blanched unwithered cheek,                       
    Thy temples fringed with locks of gleaming white,
    And head that droops because the soul is meek,
    Thee with the welcome Snowdrop I compare;
    That child of winter, prompting thoughts that climb               
    From desolation toward the genial prime;
    Or with the Moon conquering earth's misty air,
    And filling more and more with crystal light
    As pensive Evening deepens into night.
