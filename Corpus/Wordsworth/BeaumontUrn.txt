Ye Lime-trees, ranged before this hallowed Urn,
    Shoot forth with lively power at Spring's return;
    And be not slow a stately growth to rear
    Of pillars, branching off from year to year,
    Till they have learned to frame a darksome aisle;--         
    That may recal to mind that awful Pile
    Where Reynolds, 'mid our country's noblest dead,
    In the last sanctity of fame is laid.
    --There, though by right the excelling Painter sleep
    Where Death and Glory a joint sabbath keep,                 
    Yet not the less his Spirit would hold dear
    Self-hidden praise, and Friendship's private tear:
    Hence, on my patrimonial grounds, have I
    Raised this frail tribute to his memory;
    From youth a zealous follower of the Ar
    That he professed; attached to him in heart;
    Admiring, loving, and with grief and pride
    Feeling what England lost when Reynolds died.
