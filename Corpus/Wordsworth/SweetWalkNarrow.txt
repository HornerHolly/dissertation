 Sweet was the walk along the narrow lane
    At noon, the bank and hedgerows all the way
    Shagged with wild pale green tufts of fragrant hay,
    Caught by the hawthorns from the loaded wain
    Which Age, with many a slow stoop, strove to gain;                 
    And Childhood seeming still more busy, took
    His little rake with cunning sidelong look,
    Sauntering to pluck the strawberries wild unseen.
    _Now_ too, on melancholyâ€™s idle dream
    Musing, the lone spot with my soul agrees                         
    Quiet and dark; for through the thick-wove trees
    Scarce peeps the curious star till solemn gleams
    The clouded moon, and calls me forth to stray
    Through tall green silent woods and ruins grey.
