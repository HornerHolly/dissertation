 Yet more,--round many a Convent's blazing fire
    Unhallowed threads of revelry are spun;
    There Venus sits disguis√®d like a Nun,--
    While Bacchus, clothed in semblance of a Friar,
    Pours out his choicest beverage high and higher                    
    Sparkling, until it cannot choose but run
    Over the bowl, whose silver lip hath won
    An instant kiss of masterful desire--
    To stay the precious waste. Through every brain
    The domination of the sprightly juice                             
    Spreads high conceits to madding Fancy dear,
    Till the arched roof, with resolute abuse
    Of its grave echoes, swells a choral strain,
    Whose votive burthen is--"OUR KINGDOM 'S HERE!"
