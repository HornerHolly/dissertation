 Rotha, my Spiritual Child! this head was grey
    When at the sacred font for thee I stood;
    Pledged till thou reach the verge of womanhood,
    And shalt become thy own sufficient stay:
    Too late, I feel, sweet Orphan, was the day                        
    For stedfast hope the contract to fulfil;
    Yet shall my blessing hover o'er thee still,
    Embodied in the music of this Lay,
    Breathed forth beside the peaceful mountain Stream
    Whose murmur soothed thy languid Mother's ear                     
    After her throes, this Stream of name more dear
    Since thou dost bear it,--a memorial theme
    For others; for thy future self, a spell
    To summon fancies out of Time's dark cell.
