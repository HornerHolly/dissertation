Though the bold wings of Poesy affect
    The clouds, and wheel around the mountain tops
    Rejoicing, from her loftiest height she drops
    Well pleased to skim the plain with wild flowers deckt,
    Or muse in solemn grove whose shades protect                      
    The lingering dew--there steals along, or stops
    Watching the least small bird that round her hops,
    Or creeping worm, with sensitive respect.
    Her functions are they therefore less divine,
    Her thoughts less deep, or void of grave intent                   
    Her simplest fancies? Should that fear be thine,
    Aspiring Votary, ere thy hand present
    One offering, kneel before her modest shrine,
    With brow in penitential sorrow bent!
