  Not, like his great Compeers, indignantly
    Doth DANUBE spring to life! The wandering Stream
    (Who loves the Cross, yet to the Crescent's gleam
    Unfolds a willing breast) with infant glee
    Slips from his prison walls: and Fancy, free                   
    To follow in his track of silver light,
    Mounts on rapt wing, and with a moment's flight
    Hath reached the encincture of that gloomy sea
    Whose waves the Orphean lyre forbad to meet
    In conflict; whose rough winds forgot their jars
    To waft the heroic progeny of Greece;
    When the first Ship sailed for the Golden Fleece--
    ARGO--exalted for that daring feat
    To fix in heaven her shape distinct with stars.
