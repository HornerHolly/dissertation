 What strong allurement draws, what spirit guides,
    Thee, Vesper! brightening still, as if the nearer
    Thou com’st to man’s abode the spot grew dearer
    Night after night? True is it Nature hides
    Her treasures less and less.--Man now presides                     
    In power, where once he trembled in his weakness;
    Science advances with gigantic strides;
    But are we aught enriched in love and meekness?
    Aught dost thou see, bright Star! of pure and wise
    More than in humbler times graced human story;                    
    That makes our hearts more apt to sympathise
    With heaven, our souls more fit for future glory,
    When earth shall vanish from our closing eyes,
    Ere we lie down in our last dormitory?
