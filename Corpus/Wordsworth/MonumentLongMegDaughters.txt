 A weight of awe, not easy to be borne,
    Fell suddenly upon my Spirit--cast
    From the dread bosom of the unknown past,
    When first I saw that family forlorn.
    Speak Thou, whose massy strength and stature scorn
    The power of years--pre-eminent, and placed                        
    Apart, to overlook the circle vast--
    Speak, Giant-mother! tell it to the Morn
    While she dispels the cumbrous shades of Night;
    Let the Moon hear, emerging from a cloud;                         
    At whose behest uprose on British ground
    That Sisterhood, in hieroglyphic round
    Forth-shadowing, some have deemed, the infinite
    The inviolable God, that tames the proud!
