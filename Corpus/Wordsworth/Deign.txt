  Deign, Sovereign Mistress! to accept a lay,
      No Laureate offering of elaborate art;
    But salutation taking its glad way
      From deep recesses of a loyal heart.

    Queen, Wife, and Mother! may All-judging Heaven                    
      Shower with a bounteous hand on Thee and Thine
    Felicity that only can be given
      On earth to goodness blest by grace divine.

    Lady! devoutly honoured and beloved
      Through every realm confided to thy sway;                       
    Mayst thou pursue thy course by God approved,
      And He will teach thy people to obey.

    As thou art wont, thy sovereignty adorn
      With woman’s gentleness, yet firm and staid;
    So shall that earthly crown thy brows have worn                   
      Be changed for one whose glory cannot fade.

    And now, by duty urged, I lay this Book
      Before thy Majesty, in humble trust
    That on its simplest pages thou wilt look
      With a benign indulgence more than just.                        

    Nor wilt thou blame an aged Poet’s prayer,
    That issuing hence may steal into thy mind
    Some solace under weight of royal care,
    Or grief--the inheritance of humankind.

    For know we not that from celestial spheres,                      
    When Time was young, an inspiration came
    (Oh, were it mine!) to hallow saddest tears,
    And help life onward in its noblest aim.
