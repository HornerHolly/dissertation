 I watch, and long have watched, with calm regret
    Yon slowly sinking star immortal Sire
    So might he seem of all the glittering quire!
    Blue ether still surrounds him yet and yet;
    But now the horizon's rocky parapet                            
    Is reached, where, forfeiting his bright attire,
    He burns transmuted to a dusky fire 
    Then pays submissively the appointed debt
    To the flying moments, and is seen no more.
    Angels and gods! We struggle with our fate,                   
    While health, power, glory, from their height decline,
    Depressed; and then extinguished: and our state,
    In this, how different, lost Star, from thine,
    That no to-morrow shall our beams restore!
