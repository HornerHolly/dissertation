 But liberty, and triumphs on the Main,
    And laurelled armies, not to be withstood--
    What serve they? if, on transitory good
    Intent, and sedulous of abject gain,
    The State (ah, surely not preserved in vain!)                      
    Forbear to shape due channels which the Flood
    Of sacred truth may enter--till it brood
    O'er the wide realm, as o'er the Egyptian plain
    The all-sustaining Nile. No more--the time
    Is conscious of her want; through England's bounds,
    In rival haste, the wished-for Temples rise!
    I hear their sabbath bells' harmonious chime
    Float on the breeze--the heavenliest of all sounds
    That vale or hill prolongs or multiplies!
