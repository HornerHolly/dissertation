Weep not, beloved Friends! nor let the air
    For me with sighs be troubled. Not from life
    Have I been taken; this is genuine life
    And this alone the life which now I live
    In peace eternal; where desire and joy                       
    Together move in fellowship without end.
    Francesco Ceni willed that, after death,
    His tombstone thus should speak for him. And surely
    Small cause there is for that fond wish of ours
    Long to continue in this world; a world                     
    That keeps not faith, nor yet can point a hope
    To good, whereof itself is destitute.
