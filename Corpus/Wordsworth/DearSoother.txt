  And oh! dear soother of the pensive breast,
    Let homelier words without offence attest
    How where on random topics as they hit
    The moments’ humour, rough Tars spend their wit.
    Thy changes, which to wiser Spirits seem                           
    Dark as a riddle, prove a favourite theme;
    Thy motions, intricate and manifold,
    Oft help to make bold fancy’s flight more bold;
    Beget strange themes; and to freaks give birth
    Of speech as wild as ever heightened mirth.
