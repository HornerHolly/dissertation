Alas! full soon did man created pure,
    By Angels guarded, deviate from the line
    Of innocence, and woeful forfeiture
    Incur by wilful breach of law divine.
    Even so Christ's church, how prone was she to appear
    Obedient to her Lord, how prompt to twine
    'Mid glorious flowers that shall for aye endure,
    Weeds on whose front the world hath fixed her sign.
    So Man, if with thy trials thus it fares,
    And good can smooth the way to evil choice,
    From hasty censure be the mind kept free.
    He only judges right who weighs, compares,
    And in the sternest sentence, which his voice
    May utter, ne'er abandons Charity.
