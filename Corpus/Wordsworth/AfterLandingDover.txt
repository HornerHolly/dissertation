Where be the noisy followers of the game
    Which faction breeds; the turmoil where? that passed
    Through Europe, echoing from the newsman's blast,
    And filled our hearts with grief for England's shame.
    Peace greets us;--rambling on without an aim                   
    We mark majestic herds of cattle, free
    To ruminate, couched on the grassy lea;
    And hear far-off the mellow horn proclaim
    The Season's harmless pastime. Ruder sound
    Stirs not; enrapt I gaze with strange delight,                
    While consciousnesses, not to be disowned,
    Here only serve a feeling to invite
    That lifts the spirit to a calmer height,
    And makes this rural stillness more profound.
