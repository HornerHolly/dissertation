 O dearer far than light and life are dear,
    Full oft our human foresight I deplore;
    Trembling, through my unworthiness, with fear
    That friends, by death disjoined, may meet no more!

    Misgivings, hard to vanquish or control,                           
    Mix with the day, and cross the hour of rest;
    While all the future, for thy purer soul,
    With "sober certainties" of love is blest.

    That sigh of thine, not meant for human ear,
    Tells that these words thy humbleness offend;                
    Yet bear me up --else faltering in the rear
    Of a steep march: support me to the end.

    Peace settles where the intellect is meek,
    And Love is dutiful in thought and deed;
    Through Thee communion with that Love I seek:                     
    The faith Heaven strengthens where _he_ moulds the Creed.
