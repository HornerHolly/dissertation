Rapt above earth by power of one fair face,
    Hers in whose sway alone my heart delights,
    I mingle with the blest on those pure heights
    Where Man, yet mortal, rarely finds a place.
    With Him who made the Work that Work accords                       
    So well, that by its help and through his grace
    I raise my thoughts, inform my deeds and words,
    Clasping her beauty in my soulâ€™s embrace.
    Thus, if from two fair eyes mine cannot turn,
    I feel how in their presence doth abide                           
    Light which to God is both the way and guide;
    And, kindling at their lustre, if I burn,
    My noble fire emits the joyful ray
    That through the realms of glory shines for aye.
