 We saw, but surely, in the motley crowd,
    Not one of us has felt the far-famed sight;
    How _could_ we feel it? each the other's blight,
    Hurried and hurrying, volatile and loud.
    O for those motions only that invite                               
    The Ghost of Fingal to his tuneful Cave
    By the breeze entered, and wave after wave
    Softly embosoming the timid light!
    And by _one_ Votary who at will might stand
    Gazing, and take into his mind and heart,                         
    With undistracted reverence, the effect
    Of those proportions where the almighty hand
    That made the worlds, the sovereign Architect,
    Has deigned to work as if with human Art!
