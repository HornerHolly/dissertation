 "_Here Man more purely lives, less oft doth fall,_
    _More promptly rises, walks with stricter heed,_
    _More safely rests, dies happier, is freed_
    _Earlier from cleansing fires, and gains withal_
    _A brighter crown._"--On yon Cistertian wall                  
    _That_ confident assurance may be read;
    And, to like shelter, from the world have fled
    Increasing multitudes. The potent call
    Doubtless shall cheat full oft the heart's desires:
    Yet, while the rugged Age on pliant knee                          
    Vows to rapt Fancy humble fealty,
    A gentler life spreads round the holy spires;
    Where'er they rise, the sylvan waste retires,
    And aÃ«ry harvests crown the fertile lea.
