 Realms quake by turns: proud Arbitress of grace,
    The Church, by mandate shadowing forth the power
    She arrogates o'er heaven's eternal door,
    Closes the gates of every sacred place.
    Straight from the sun and tainted air's embrace                    
    All sacred things are covered: cheerful morn
    Grows sad as night--no seemly garb is worn,
    Nor is a face allowed to meet a face
    With natural smiles of greeting. Bells are dumb;
    Ditches are graves--funereal rites denied;                        
    And in the church-yard he must take his bride
    Who dares be wedded! Fancies thickly come
    Into the pensive heart ill fortified,
    And comfortless despairs the soul benumb.
