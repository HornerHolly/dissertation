Grieve for the Man who hither came bereft,
    And seeking consolation from above;
    Nor grieve the less that skill to him was left
    To paint this picture of his lady-love:
    Can she, a blessed saint, the work approve?                        
    And O, good Brethren of the cowl, a thing
    So fair, to which with peril he must cling,
    Destroy in pity, or with care remove.
    That bloom--those eyes--can they assist to bind
    Thoughts that would stray from Heaven? The dream must cease       
    To be; by Faith, not sight, his soul must live;
    Else will the enamoured Monk too surely find
    How wide a space can part from inward peace
    The most profound repose his cell can give.
