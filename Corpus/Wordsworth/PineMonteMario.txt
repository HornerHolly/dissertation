 I saw far off the dark top of a Pine
    Look like a cloud a slender stem the tie
    That bound it to its native earth poised high
    Mid evening hues, along the horizon line,
    Striving in peace each other to outshine.                          
    But when I learned the Tree was living there,
    Saved from the sordid axe by Beaumont care,
    Oh, what a gush of tenderness was mine!
    The rescued Pinetree, with its sky so bright
    And cloudlike beauty, rich in thoughts of home,                  
    Death-parted friends, and days too swift in flight,
    Supplanted the whole majesty of Rome
    (Then first apparent from the Pincian Height)
    Crowned with St. Peter everlasting dome.
