Fair Land! Thee all men greet with joy; how few,
    Whose souls take pride in freedom, virtue, fame,
    Part from thee without pity dyed in shame:
    I could not--while from Venice we withdrew,
    Led on till an Alpine strait confined our view
    Within its depths, and to the shore we came
    Of Lago Morto, dreary sight and name,
    Which o’er sad thoughts a sadder colouring threw.
    Italia! on the surface of thy spirit,
    (Too aptly emblemed by that torpid lake)                          
    Shall a few partial breezes only creep?--
    Be its depths quickened; what thou dost inherit
    Of the world’s hopes, dare to fulfil; awake,
    Mother of Heroes, from thy death-like sleep!
