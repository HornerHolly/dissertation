 Methinks 'twere no unprecedented feat
    Should some benignant Minister of air
    Lift, and encircle with a cloudy chair,
    The One for whom my heart shall ever beat
    With tenderest love;--or, if a safer seat                      
    Atween his downy wings be furnished, there
    Would lodge her, and the cherished burden bear
    O'er hill and valley to this dim retreat!
    Rough ways my steps have trod; too rough and long
    For her companionship; here dwells soft ease:                 
    With sweets that she partakes not some distaste
    Mingles, and lurking consciousness of wrong;
    Languish the flowers; the waters seem to waste
    Their vocal charm; their sparklings cease to please.
