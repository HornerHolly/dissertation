If the whole weight of what we think and feel,
    Save only far as thought and feeling blend
    With action, were as nothing, patriot Friend!
    From thy remonstrance would be no appeal;
    But to promote and fortify the weal                                
    Of our own Being is her paramount end;
    A truth which they alone shall comprehend
    Who shun the mischief which they cannot heal.
    Peace in these feverish times is sovereign bliss:
    Here, with no thirst but what the stream can slake,               
    And startled only by the rustling brake,
    Cool air I breathe; while the unincumbered Mind,
    By some weak aims at services assigned
    To gentle Natures, thanks not Heaven amiss.
