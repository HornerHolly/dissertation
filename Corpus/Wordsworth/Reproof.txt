But what if One, through grove or flowery meed,
    Indulging thus at will the creeping feet
    Of a voluptuous indolence, should meet
    Thy hovering Shade, O venerable Bede!
    The saint, the scholar, from a circle freed                       
    Of toil stupendous, in a hallowed seat
    Of learning, where thou heard'st the billows beat
    On a wild coast, rough monitors to feed
    Perpetual industry. Sublime Recluse!
    The recreant soul, that dares to shun the debt                    
    Imposed on human kind, must first forget
    Thy diligence, thy unrelaxing use
    Of a long life; and, in the hour of death,
    The last dear service of thy passing breath!
