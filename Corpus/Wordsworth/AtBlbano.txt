    Days passed and Monte Calvo would not clear
    His head from mist; and, as the wind sobbed through
    Albanos dripping Ilex avenue,
    My dull forebodings in a Peasants ear
    Found casual vent. She said, Be of good cheer;                    
    Our yesterday procession did not sue
    In vain; the sky will change to sunny blue,
    Thanks to our Lady grace. I smiled to hear,
    But not in scorn the Matrons Faith may lack
    The heavenly sanction needed to ensure                            
    Fulfilment; but, we trust, her upward track
    Stops not at this low point, nor wants the lure
    Of flowers the Virgin without fear may own,
    For by her Sons blest hand the seed was sown.
