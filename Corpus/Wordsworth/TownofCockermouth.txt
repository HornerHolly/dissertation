 A point of life between my Parents' dust,
    And yours, my buried Little-ones! am I;
    And to those graves looking habitually
    In kindred quiet I repose my trust.
    Death to the innocent is more than just,                           
    And, to the sinner, mercifully bent;
    So may I hope, if truly I repent
    And meekly bear the ills which bear I must:
    And You, my Offspring! that do still remain,
    Yet may outstrip me in the appointed race,                        
    If e'er, through fault of mine, in mutual pain
    We breathed together for a moment's space,
    The wrong, by love provoked, let love arraign,
    And only love keep in your hearts a place.
