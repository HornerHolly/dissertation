   Lyre! though such power do in thy magic live
      As might from India farthest plain
      Recal the not unwilling Maid,
          Assist me to detain
          The lovely Fugitive:                                         
    Check with thy notes the impulse which, betrayed
    By her sweet farewell looks, I longed to aid.
    Here let me gaze enrapt upon that eye,
    The impregnable and awe-inspiring fort
    Of contemplation, the calm port                                   
    By reason fenced from winds that sigh
    Among the restless sails of vanity.
    But if no wish be hers that we should part,
    A humbler bliss would satisfy my heart.
          Where all things are so fair,                               
    Enough by her dear side to breathe the air
          Of this Elysian weather;
    And, on or in, or near, the brook, espy
      Shade upon the sunshine lying
          Faint and somewhat pensively;                               
      And downward Image gaily vying
          With its upright living tree
    Mid silver clouds, and openings of blue sky
    As soft almost and deep as her cerulean eye.

    Nor less the joy with many a glance                               
    Cast up the Stream or down at her beseeching,
    To mark its eddying foam-balls prettily distrest
    By ever-changing shape and want of rest;
          Or watch, with mutual teaching,
          The current as it plays                                     
          In flashing leaps and stealthy creeps
          Adown a rocky maze;
    Or note translucent summer happiest chance!
    In the slope-channel floored with pebbles bright,
    Stones of all hues, gem emulous of gem,                           
    So vivid that they take from keenest sight
    The liquid veil that seeks not to hide them.
