Chatsworth! thy stately mansion, and the pride
    Of thy domain, strange contrast do present
    To house and home in many a craggy rent
    Of the wild Peak; where new-born waters glide
    Through fields whose thrifty occupants abide                       
    As in a dear and chosen banishment,
    With every semblance of entire content;
    So kind is simple Nature, fairly tried!
    Yet He whose heart in childhood gave her troth
    To pastoral dales, thin-set with modest farms,                    
    May learn, if judgment strengthen with his growth,
    That, not for Fancy only, pomp hath charms;
    And, strenuous to protect from lawless harms
    The extremes of favoured life, may honour both.
