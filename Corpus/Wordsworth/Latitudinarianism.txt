Yet Truth is keenly sought for, and the wind
    Charged with rich words poured out in thought's defence;
    Whether the Church inspire that eloquence,
    Or a Platonic Piety confined
    To the sole temple of the inward mind;
    And One there is who builds immortal lays,
    Though doomed to tread in solitary ways,
    Darkness before and danger's voice behind;
    Yet not alone, nor helpless to repel
    Sad thoughts; for from above the starry sphere                    
    Come secrets, whispered nightly to his ear;
    And the pure spirit of celestial light
    Shines through his soul--"that he may see and tell
    Of things invisible to mortal sight."
