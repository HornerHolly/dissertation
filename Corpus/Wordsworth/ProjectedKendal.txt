 Is then no nook of English ground secure
    From rash assault? Schemes of retirement sown
    In youth, and mid the busy world kept pure
    As when their earliest flowers of hope were blown,
    Must perish how can they this blight endure?                     
    And must he too the ruthless change bemoan
    Who scorns a false utilitarian lure
    Mid his paternal fields at random thrown?
    Baffle the threat, bright Scene, from Orrest-head
    Given to the pausing traveller rapturous glance:                
    Plead for thy peace, thou beautiful romance
    Of nature; and, if human hearts be dead,
    Speak, passing winds; ye torrents, with your strong
    And constant voice, protest against the wrong.
