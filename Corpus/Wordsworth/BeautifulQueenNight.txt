 How beautiful the Queen of Night, on high
    Her way pursuing among scattered clouds,
    Where, ever and anon, her head she shrouds
    Hidden from view in dense obscurity.
    But look, and to the watchful eye
    A brightening edge will indicate that soon
    We shall behold the struggling Moon
    Break forth again to walk the clear blue sky.
