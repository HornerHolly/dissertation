 Oh what a Wreck! how changed in mien and speech!
    Yet though dread Powers, that work in mystery, spin
    Entanglings of the brain; though shadows stretch
    O’er the chilled heart reflect; far, far within
    Hers is a holy Being, freed from Sin.                              
    She is not what she seems, a forlorn wretch,
    But delegated Spirits comfort fetch
    To Her from heights that Reason may not win.
    Like Children, She is privileged to hold
    Divine communion; both do live and move,                      
    Whate’er to shallow Faith their ways unfold,
    Inly illumined by Heaven’s pitying love;
    Love pitying innocence not long to last,
    In them in Her our sins and sorrows past.
