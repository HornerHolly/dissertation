There are no colours in the fairest sky
    So fair as these. The feather, whence the pen
    Was shaped that traced the lives of these good men,
    Dropped from an Angels wing.With moistened eye
    We read of faith and purest charity                                
    In Statesman, Priest, and humble Citizen:
    O could we copy their mild virtues, then
    What joy to live, what blessedness to die!
    Methinks their very names shine still and bright;
    Apart like glowworms on a summer night;                         
    Or lonely tapers when from far they fling
    A guiding ray; or seen like stars on high,
    Satellites burning in a lucid ring
    Around meek Waltons heavenly memory.
