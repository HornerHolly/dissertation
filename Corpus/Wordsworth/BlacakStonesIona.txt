 Here on their knees men swore; the stones were black,
    Black in the people's minds and words,yet they
    Were at that time, as now, in colour grey.
    But what is colour, if upon the rack
    Of conscience souls are placed by deeds that lack                  
    Concord with oaths? What differ night and day
    Then, when before the Perjured on his way
    Hell opens, and the heavens in vengeance crack
    Above his head uplifted in vain prayer
    To Saint, or Fiend, or to the Godhead whom                   
    He had insulted Peasant, King, or Thane?
    Fly where the culprit may, guilt meets a doom;
    And, from invisible worlds at need laid bare,
    Come links for social order's awful chain. Here on their knees men swore; the stones were black,
