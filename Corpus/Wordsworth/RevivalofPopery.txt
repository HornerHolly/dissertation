 The saintly Youth has ceased to rule, discrowned
    By unrelenting Death.O People keen
    For change, to whom the new looks always green!
    Rejoicing did they cast upon the ground
    Their Gods of wood and stone; and, at the sound                    
    Of counter-proclamation, now are seen,
    (Proud triumph is it for a sullen Queen!)
    Lifting them up, the worship to confound
    Of the Most High. Again do they invoke
    The Creature, to the Creature glory give;                         
    Again with frankincense the altars smoke
    Like those the Heathen served; and mass is sung;
    And prayer, man's rational prerogative,
    Runs through blind channels of an unknown tongue.
