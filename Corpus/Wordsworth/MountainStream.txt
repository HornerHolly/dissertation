  O mountain Stream! the Shepherd and his Cot
    Are privileged Inmates of deep solitude;
    Nor would the nicest Anchorite exclude
    A field or two of brighter green, or plot
    Of tillage-ground, that seemeth like a spot                    
    Of stationary sunshine:--thou hast viewed
    These only, Duddon! with their paths renewed
    By fits and starts, yet this contents thee not.
    Thee hath some awful Spirit impelled to leave,
    Utterly to desert, the haunts of men,
    Though simple thy companions were and few;
    And through this wilderness a passage cleave
    Attended but by thy own voice, save when
    The clouds and fowls of the air thy way pursue!
