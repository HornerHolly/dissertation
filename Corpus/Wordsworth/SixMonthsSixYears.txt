 Companion! by whose buoyant Spirit cheered,
    In whose experience trusting, day by day
    Treasures I gained with zeal that neither feared
    The toils nor felt the crosses of the way,
    These records take, and happy should I be                          
    Were but the Gift a meet Return to thee
    For kindnesses that never ceased to flow,
    And prompt self-sacrifice to which I owe
    Far more than any heart but mine can know.

                            

    Ye Apennines! with all your fertile vales
    Deeply embosomed, and your winding shores
    Of either sea, an Islander by birth,
    A Mountaineer by habit, would resound
    Your praise, in meet accordance with your claims                   
    Bestowed by Nature, or from man’s great deeds
    Inherited presumptuous thought it fled
    Like vapour, like a towering cloud, dissolved.
    Not, therefore, shall my mind give way to sadness;--
    Yon snow-white torrent-fall, plumb down it drops                  
    Yet ever hangs or seems to hang in air,
    Lulling the leisure of that high perched town,
    AQUAPENDENTE, in her lofty site
    Its neighbour and its namesake town, and flood
    Forth flashing out of its own gloomy chasm                        
    Bright sunbeams the fresh verdure of this lawn
    Strewn with grey rocks, and on the horizon verge,
    O’er intervenient waste, through glimmering haze,
    Unquestionably kenned, that cone-shaped hill
    With fractured summit, no indifferent sight                   
    To travellers, from such comforts as are thine,
    Bleak Radicofani! escaped with joy
    These are before me; and the varied scene
    May well suffice, till noon-tide sultry heat
    Relax, to fix and satisfy the mind                                
    Passive yet pleased. What! with this Broom in flower
    Close at my side! She bids me fly to greet
    Her sisters, soon like her to be attired
    With golden blossoms opening at the feet
    Of my own Fairfield. The glad greeting given,                 
    Given with a voice and by a look returned
    Of old companionship, Time counts not minutes
    Ere, from accustomed paths, familiar fields,
    The local Genius hurries me aloft,
    Transported over that cloud-wooing hill,                          
    Seat Sandal, a fond suitor of the clouds,
    With dream-like smoothness, to Helvellyn top,
    There to alight upon crisp moss and range,
    Obtaining ampler boon, at every step,
    Of visual sovereignty hills multitudinous,                       
    (Not Apennine can boast of fairer) hills
    Pride of two nations, wood and lake and plains,
    And prospect right below of deep coves shaped
    By skeleton arms, that, from the mountain trunk
    Extended, clasp the winds, with mutual moan                       
    Struggling for liberty, while undismayed
    The shepherd struggles with them. Onward thence
    And downward by the skirt of Greenside fell,
    And by Glenridding-screes, and low Glencoign,
    Places forsaken now, though loving still                      
    The muses, as they loved them in the days
    Of the old minstrels and the border bards.--
    But here am I fast bound; and let it pass,
    The simple rapture who that travels far
    To feed his mind with watchful eyes could share                   
    Or wish to share it? One there surely was,
    The Wizard of the North with anxious hope
    Brought to this genial climate, when disease
    Preyed upon body and mind yet not the less
    Had his sunk eye kindled at those dear words                      
    That spake of bards and minstrels; and his spirit
    Had flown with mine to old Helvellyn brow,
    Where once together, in his day of strength,
    We stood rejoicing, as if earth were free
    From sorrow, like the sky above our heads.                        

      Years followed years, and when, upon the eve
    Of his last going from Tweed-side, thought turned,
    Or by another sympathy was led,
    To this bright land, Hope was for him no friend,
    Knowledge no help Imagination shaped                             
    No promise. Still, in more than ear-deep seats,
    Survives for me, and cannot but survive
    The tone of voice which wedded borrowed words
    To sadness not their own, when, with faint smile
    Forced by intent to take from speech its edge,                    
    He said, When I am there, although tis fair,
    Twill be another Yarrow Prophecy
    More than fulfilled, as gay Campania shores
    Soon witnessed, and the city of seven hills,
    Her sparkling fountains, and her mouldering tombs;                
    And more than all, that Eminence which showed
    Her splendours, seen, not felt, the while he stood
    A few short steps (painful they were) apart
    From Tasso Convent-haven, and retired grave.

      Peace to their Spirits! why should Poesy                        
    Yield to the lure of vain regret, and hover
    In gloom on wings with confidence outspread
    To move in sunshine Utter thanks, my Soul!
    Tempered with awe, and sweetened by compassion
    For them who in the shades of sorrow dwell,                       
    That I so near the term to human life
    Appointed by man common heritage,
    Frail as the frailest, one withal if that
    Deserve a thought but little known to fame--
    Am free to rove where Nature loveliest looks,                   
    Art noblest relics, history rich bequests,
    Failed to reanimate and but feebly cheered
    The whole world Darling free to rove at will
    O’er high and low, and if requiring rest,
    Rest from enjoyment only.
                              Thanks poured forth                    
    For what thus far hath blessed my wanderings, thanks
    Fervent but humble as the lips can breathe
    Where gladness seems a duty--let me guard
    Those seeds of expectation which the fruit
    Already gathered in this favoured Land                           
    Enfolds within its core. The faith be mine,
    That He who guides and governs all, approves
    When gratitude, though disciplined to look
    Beyond these transient spheres, doth wear a crown
    Of earthly hope put on with trembling hand;                      
    Nor is least pleased, we trust, when golden beams,
    Reflected through the mists of age, from hours
    Of innocent delight, remote or recent,
    Shoot but a little way tis all they can
    Into the doubtful future. Who would keep                         
    Power must resolve to cleave to it through life,
    Else it deserts him, surely as he lives.
    Saints would not grieve nor guardian angels frown
    If one while tossed, as was my lot to be,
    In a frail bark urged by two slender oars                        
    Over waves rough and deep,that, when they broke,
    Dashed their white foam against the palace walls
    Of Genoa the superb should there be led
    To meditate upon his own appointed tasks,
    However humble in themselves, with thoughts                      
    Raised and sustained by memory of Him
    Who oftentimes within those narrow bounds
    Rocked on the surge, there tried his spirit strength
    And grasp of purpose, long ere sailed his ship
    To lay a new world open.
                              Nor less prized                        
    Be those impressions which incline the heart
    To mild, to lowly, and to seeming weak,
    Bend that way her desires. The dew, the storm
    The dew whose moisture fell in gentle drops
    On the small hyssop destined to become,                          
    By Hebrew ordinance devoutly kept,
    A purifying instrument the storm
    That shook on Lebanon the cedar top,
    And as it shook, enabling the blind roots
    Further to force their way, endowed its trunk                    
    With magnitude and strength fit to uphold
    The glorious temple did alike proceed
    From the same gracious will, were both an offspring
    Of bounty infinite.
                          Between Powers that aim
    Higher to lift their lofty heads, impelled                       
    By no profane ambition, Powers that thrive
    By conflict, and their opposites, that trust
    In lowliness a mid way tract there lies
    Of thoughtful sentiment for every mind
    Pregnant with good. Young, Middle-aged, and Old,                 
    From century on to century, must have known
    The emotion nay, more fitly were it said--
    The blest tranquillity that sunk so deep
    Into my spirit, when I paced, enclosed
    In Pisa Campo Santo, the smooth floor                      
    Of its Arcades paved with sepulchral slabs,
    And through each window open fret-work looked
    O’er the blank Area of sacred earth
    Fetched from Mount Calvary, or haply delved
    In precincts nearer to the Saviour tomb,                       
    By hands of men, humble as brave, who fought
    For its deliverance a capacious field
    That to descendants of the dead it holds
    And to all living mute memento breathes,
    More touching far than aught which on the walls                  
    Is pictured, or their epitaphs can speak,
    Of the changed City long-departed power,
    Glory, and wealth, which, perilous as they are,
    Here did not kill, but nourished, Piety.
    And, high above that length of cloistral roof,                   
    Peering in air and backed by azure sky,
    To kindred contemplations ministers
    The Baptistery dome, and that which swells
    From the Cathedral pile; and with the twain
    Conjoined in prospect mutable or fixed                           
    (As hurry on in eagerness the feet,
    Or pause) the summit of the Leaning-tower.
    Nor less remuneration waits on him
    Who having left the Cemetery stands
    In the Tower shadow, of decline and fall                       
    Admonished not without some sense of fear,
    Fear that soon vanishes before the sight
    Of splendour unextinguished, pomp unscathed,
    And beauty unimpaired. Grand in itself,
    And for itself, the assemblage, grand and fair                   
    To view, and for the mind consenting eye
    A type of age in man, upon its front
    Bearing the world-acknowledged evidence
    Of past exploits, nor fondly after more
    Struggling against the stream of destiny,                        
    But with its peaceful majesty content.
    --Oh what a spectacle at every turn
    The Place unfolds, from pavement skinned with moss,
    Or grass-grown spaces, where the heaviest foot
    Provokes no echoes, but must softly tread;                       
    Where Solitude with Silence paired stops short
    Of Desolation, and to Ruin scythe
    Decay submits not.
                          But whereer my steps
    Shall wander, chiefly let me cull with care
    Those images of genial beauty, oft                               
    Too lovely to be pensive in themselves
    But by reflection made so, which do best
    And fitliest serve to crown with fragrant wreaths
    Life cup when almost filled with years, like mine.
    --How lovely robed in forenoon light and shade,                  
    Each ministering to each, didst thou appear
    Savona, Queen of territory fair
    As aught that marvellous coast thro all its length
    Yields to the Stranger eye. Remembrance holds
    As a selected treasure thy one cliff,                            
    That, while it wore for melancholy crest
    A shattered Convent, yet rose proud to have
    Clinging to its steep sides a thousand herbs
    And shrubs, whose pleasant looks gave proof how kind
    The breath of air can be where earth had else                    
    Seemed churlish. And behold, both far and near,
    Garden and field all decked with orange bloom,
    And peach and citron, in Spring mildest breeze
    Expanding; and, along the smooth shore curved
    Into a natural port, a tideless sea,                             
    To that mild breeze with motion and with voice
    Softly responsive; and, attuned to all
    Those vernal charms of sight and sound, appeared
    Smooth space of turf which from the guardian fort
    Sloped seaward, turf whose tender April green,                   
    In coolest climes too fugitive, might even here
    Plead with the sovereign Sun for longer stay
    Than his unmitigated beams allow,
    Nor plead in vain, if beauty could preserve,
    From mortal change, aught that is born on earth                  
    Or doth on time depend.
                            While on the brink
    Of that high Convent-crested cliff I stood,
    Modest Savona! over all did brood
    A pure poetic Spirit as the breeze,
    Mild as the verdure, fresh the sunshine, bright           
    Thy gentle Chiabrera! not a stone,
    Mural or level with the trodden floor,
    In Church or Chapel, if my curious quest
    Missed not the truth, retains a single name
    Of young or old, warrior, or saint, or sage,                     
    To whose dear memories his sepulchral verse
    Paid simple tribute, such as might have flowed
    From the clear spring of a plain English heart,
    Say rather, one in native fellowship
    With all who want not skill to couple grief                      
    With praise, as genuine admiration prompts.
    The grief, the praise, are severed from their dust,
    Yet in his page the records of that worth
    Survive, uninjured glory then to words,
    Honour to word-preserving Arts, and hail                         
    Ye kindred local influences that still,
    If Hope’s familiar whispers merit faith,
    Await my steps when they the breezy height
    Shall range of philosophic Tusculum;
    Or Sabine vales explored inspire a wish                      
    To meet the shade of Horace by the side
    Of his Bandusian fount; or I invoke
    His presence to point out the spot where once
    He sate, and eulogized with earnest pen
    Peace, leisure, freedom, moderate desires;                       
    And all the immunities of rural life
    Extolled, behind Vacuna crumbling fane.
    Or let me loiter, soothed with what is given
    Nor asking more, on that delicious Bay,
    Parthenope Domain Virgilian haunt,                            
    Illustrated with never-dying verse,
    And, by the Poet laurel-shaded tomb,
    Age after age to Pilgrims from all lands
    Endeared.
                And who if not a man as cold
    In heart as dull in brain while pacing ground                   
    Chosen by Rome’s legendary Bards, high minds
    Out of her early struggles well inspired
    To localize heroic acts could look
    Upon the spots with undelighted eye,
    Though even to their last syllable the Lays                      
    And very names of those who gave them birth
    Have perished Verily, to her utmost depth,
    Imagination feels what Reason fears not
    To recognize, the lasting virtue lodged
    In those bold fictions that, by deeds assigned                   
    To the Valerian, Fabian, Curian Race,
    And others like in fame, created Powers
    With attributes from History derived,
    By Poesy irradiate, and yet graced,
    Through marvellous felicity of skill,                            
    With something more propitious to high aims
    Than either, pent within her separate sphere,
    Can oft with justice claim.
                                And not disdaining
    Union with those primeval energies
    To virtue consecrate, stoop ye from your height                 
    Christian Traditions! at my Spirit call
    Descend, and, on the brow of ancient Rome
    As she survives in ruin, manifest
    Your glories mingled with the brightest hues
    Of her memorial halo, fading, fading,                            
    But never to be extinct while Earth endures.
    O come, if undishonoured by the prayer,
    From all her Sanctuaries Open for my feet
    Ye Catacombs, give to mine eyes a glimpse
    Of the Devout, as, mid your glooms convened                     
    For safety, they of yore enclasped the Cross
    On knees that ceased from trembling, or intoned
    Their orisons with voices half-suppressed,
    But sometimes heard, or fancied to be heard,
    Even at this hour.
                      And thou Mamertine prison,
    Into that vault receive me from whose depth
    Issues, revealed in no presumptuous vision,
    Albeit lifting human to divine,
    A saint, the Church Rock, the mystic Keys
    Grasped in his hand; and lo! with upright sword              
    Prefiguring his own impendent doom,
    The Apostle of the Gentiles; both prepared
    To suffer pains with heathen scorn and hate
    Inflicted blessed Men, for so to Heaven
    They follow their dear Lord!
                                  Time flows nor winds,             
    Nor stagnates, nor precipitates his course,
    But many a benefit borne upon his breast
    For human-kind sinks out of sight, is gone,
    No one knows how; nor seldom is put forth
    An angry arm that snatches good away,                            
    Never perhaps to reappear. The Stream
    Has to our generation brought and brings
    Innumerable gains; yet we, who now
    Walk in the light of day, pertain full surely
    To a chilled age, most pitiably shut out                         
    From that which _is_ and actuates, by forms,
    Abstractions, and by lifeless fact to fact
    Minutely linked with diligence uninspired,
    Unrectified, unguided, unsustained,
    By godlike insight. To this fate is doomed                       
    Science, wide-spread and spreading still as be
    Her conquests, in the world of sense made known.
    So with the internal mind it fares; and so
    With morals, trusting, in contempt or fear
    Of vital principle controlling law,                            
    To her purblind guide Expediency; and so
    Suffers religious faith. Elate with view
    Of what is won, we overlook or scorn
    The best that should keep pace with it, and must,
    Else more and more the general mind will droop,                  
    Even as if bent on perishing. There lives
    No faculty within us which the Soul
    Can spare, and humblest earthly Weal demands,
    For dignity not placed beyond her reach,
    Zealous co-operation of all means                                
    Given or acquired, to raise us from the mire,
    And liberate our hearts from low pursuits.
    By gross Utilities enslaved we need
    More of ennobling impulse from the past,
    If to the future aught of good must come                         
    Sounder and therefore holier than the ends
    Which, in the giddiness of self-applause,
    We covet as supreme. O grant the crown
    That Wisdom wears, or take his treacherous staff
    From Knowledge If the Muse, whom I have served                 
    This day, be mistress of a single pearl
    Fit to be placed in that pure diadem;
    Then, not in vain, under these chesnut boughs
    Reclined, shall I have yielded up my soul
    To transports from the secondary founts                          
    Flowing of time and place, and paid to both
    Due homage; nor shall fruitlessly have striven,
    By love of beauty moved, to enshrine in verse
    Accordant meditations, which in times
    Vexed and disordered, as our own, may shed                       
    Influence, at least among a scattered few,
    To soberness of mind and peace of heart
    Friendly; as here to my repose hath been
    This flowering broom dear neighbourhood, the light
    And murmur issuing from yon pendent flood,                       
    And all the varied landscape. Let us now
    Rise, and to-morrow greet magnificent Rome.
