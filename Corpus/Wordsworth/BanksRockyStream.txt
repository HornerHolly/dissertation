 Dogmatic Teachers, of the snow-white fur!
    Ye wrangling Schoolmen, of the scarlet hood!
    Who, with a keenness not to be withstood,
    Press the point home, or falter and demur,
    Checked in your course by many a teasing burr;                 
    These natural council-seats your acrid blood
    Might cool;--and, as the Genius of the flood
    Stoops willingly to animate and spur
    Each lighter function slumbering in the brain,
    Yon eddying balls of foam, these arrowy gleams                
    That o'er the pavement of the surging streams
    Welter and flash, a synod might detain
    With subtle speculations, haply vain,
    But surely less so than your far-fetched themes!
