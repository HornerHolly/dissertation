As, when a storm hath ceased, the birds regain
    Their cheerfulness, and busily retrim
    Their nests, or chant a gratulating hymn
    To the blue ether and bespangled plain;
    Even so, in many a re-constructed fane,                            
    Have the survivors of this Storm renewed
    Their holy rites with vocal gratitude:
    And solemn ceremonials they ordain
    To celebrate their great deliverance;
    Most feelingly instructed 'mid their fear--                       
    That persecution, blind with rage extreme,
    May not the less, through Heaven's mild countenance,
    Even in her own despite, both feed and cheer;
    For all things are less dreadful than they seem.
