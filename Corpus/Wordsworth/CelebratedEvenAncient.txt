   A Roman Master stands on Grecian ground,
    And to the people at the Isthmian Games
    Assembled, He, by a herald's voice, proclaims
    THE LIBERTY OF GREECE:--the words rebound
    Until all voices in one voice are drowned;                   
    Glad acclamation by which air was rent!
    And birds, high flying in the element,
    Dropped to the earth, astonished at the sound!
    Yet were the thoughtful grieved; and still that voice
    Haunts, with sad echoes, musing Fancy's ear:
    Ah! that a _Conqueror's_ words should be so dear:
    Ah! that a _boon_ could shed such rapturous joys!
    A gift of that which is not to be given
    By all the blended powers of Earth and Heaven.
