 From early youth I ploughed the restless Main,
    My mind as restless and as apt to change;
    Through every clime and ocean did I range,
    In hope at length a competence to gain;
    For poor to Sea I went, and poor I still remain.                   
    Year after year I strove, but strove in vain,
    And hardships manifold did I endure,
    For Fortune on me never deign'd to smile;
    Yet I at last a resting-place have found,
    With just enough life's comforts to procure,                      
    In a snug Cove on this our favoured Isle,
    A peaceful spot where Nature's gifts abound;
    Then sure I have no reason to complain,
    Though poor to Sea I went, and poor I still remain.
