Enough! for see, with dim association
    The tapers burn; the odorous incense feeds
    A greedy flame; the pompous mass proceeds;
    The Priest bestows the appointed consecration;
    And, while the HOST is raised, its elevation                       
    An awe and supernatural horror breeds;
    And all the people bow their heads, like reeds
    To a soft breeze, in lowly adoration.
    This Valdo brooks not. On the banks of Rhone
    He taught, till persecution chased him thence,                    
    To adore the Invisible, and Him alone.
    Nor are his Followers loth to seek defence,
    'Mid woods and wilds, on Nature's craggy throne,
    From rites that trample upon soul and sense.
