 A youth too certain of his power to wade
    On the smooth bottom of this clear bright sea,
    To sight so shallow, with a bather's glee,
    Leapt from this rock, and but for timely aid
    He, by the alluring element betrayed,                              
    Had perished. Then might Sea-nymphs (and with sighs
    Of self-reproach) have chanted elegies
    Bewailing his sad fate, when he was laid
    In peaceful earth: for, doubtless, he was frank,
    Utterly in himself devoid of guile;                               
    Knew not the double-dealing of a smile;
    Nor aught that makes men's promises a blank,
    Or deadly snare: and He survives to bless
    The Power that saved him in his strange distress.
