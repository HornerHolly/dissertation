Such fruitless questions may not long beguile
    Or plague the fancy 'mid the sculptured shows
    Conspicuous yet where Oroonoko flows;
    _There_ would the Indian answer with a smile
    Aimed at the White Man's ignorance the while,                  
    Of the GREAT WATERS telling how they rose,
    Covered the plains, and, wandering where they chose,
    Mounted through every intricate defile,
    Triumphant Inundation wide and deep,
    O'er which his Fathers urged, to ridge and steep              
    Else unapproachable, their buoyant way;
    And carved, on mural cliff's undreaded side,
    Sun, moon, and stars, and beast of chase or prey;
    Whateer they sought, shunned, loved, or deified!
