 Flattered with promise of escape
      From every hurtful blast,
    Spring takes, O sprightly May! thy shape,
      Her loveliest and her last.

    Less fair is summer riding high                                    
      In fierce solstitial power,
    Less fair than when a lenient sky
      Brings on her parting hour.

    When earth repays with golden sheaves
      The labours of the plough,                                      
    And ripening fruits and forest leaves
      All brighten on the bough;

    What pensive beauty autumn shows,
      Before she hears the sound
    Of winter rushing in, to close                                    
      The emblematic round!

    Such be our Spring, our Summer such;
      So may our Autumn blend
    With hoary Winter, and Life touch,
      Through heaven-born hope, her end!
