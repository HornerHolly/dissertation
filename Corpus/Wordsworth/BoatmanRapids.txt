 Jesu! bless our slender Boat,
     By the current swept along;
    Loud its threatenings let them not
     Drown the music of a song
    Breathed thy mercy to implore,                                 
    Where these troubled waters roar!

    Saviour, for our warning, seen
     Bleeding on that precious Rood;
    If, while through the meadows green
     Gently wound the peaceful flood,                             
    We forgot Thee, do not Thou
    Disregard thy Suppliants now!

    Hither, like yon ancient Tower
     Watching o'er the River's bed,
    Fling the shadow of thy power,                                
     Else we sleep among the dead;
    Thou who trod'st the billowy sea,
    Shield us in our jeopardy!

    Guide our Bark among the waves;
     Through the rocks our passage smooth;                        
    Where the whirlpool frets and raves
     Let thy love its anger soothe:
    All our hope is placed in Thee;
    _Miserere Domine!_
