Beguiled into forgetfulness of care
    Due to the day unfinished task; of pen
    Or book regardless, and of that fair scene
    In Nature prodigality displayed
    Before my window, oftentimes and long                              
    I gaze upon a Portrait whose mild gleam
    Of beauty never ceases to enrich
    The common light; whose stillness charms the air,
    Or seems to charm it, into like repose;
    Whose silence, for the pleasure of the ear,                       
    Surpasses sweetest music. There she sits
    With emblematic purity attired
    In a white vest, white as her marble neck
    Is, and the pillar of the throat would be
    But for the shadow by the drooping chin                           
    Cast into that recess the tender shade,
    The shade and light, both there and every where,
    And through the very atmosphere she breathes,
    Broad, clear, and toned harmoniously, with skill
    That might from nature have been learnt in the hour               
    When the lone shepherd sees the morning spread
    Upon the mountains. Look at her, whoeer
    Thou be that, kindling with a poet soul,
    Hast loved the painter true Promethean craft
    Intensely from Imagination take                                  
    The treasure what mine eyes behold see thou,
    Even though the Atlantic ocean roll between.

      A silver line, that runs from brow to crown
    And in the middle parts the braided hair,
    Just serves to show how delicate a soil                           
    The golden harvest grows in; and those eyes,
    Soft and capacious as a cloudless sky
    Whose azure depth their colour emulates,
    Must needs be conversant with upward looks,
    Prayer voiceless service; but now, seeking nought               
    And shunning nought, their own peculiar life
    Of motion they renounce, and with the head
    Partake its inclination towards earth
    In humble grace, and quiet pensiveness
    Caught at the point where it stops short of sadness.              

      Offspring of soul-bewitching Art, make me
    Thy confidant! say, whence derived that air
    Of calm abstraction? Can the ruling thought
    Be with some lover far away, or one
    Crossed by misfortune, or of doubted faith?                       
    Inapt conjecture! Childhood here, a moon
    Crescent in simple loveliness serene,
    Has but approached the gates of womanhood,
    Not entered them; her heart is yet unpierced
    By the blind Archer-god; her fancy free:                          
    The fount of feeling, if unsought elsewhere,
    Will not be found.

                        Her right hand, as it lies
    Across the slender wrist of the left arm
    Upon her lap reposing, holds--but mark
    How slackly, for the absent mind permits                          
    No firmer grasp--a little wild-flower, joined
    As in a posy, with a few pale ears
    Of yellowing corn, the same that overtopped
    And in their common birthplace sheltered it
    Till they were plucked together; a blue flower                  
    Called by the thrifty husbandman a weed;
    But Ceres, in her garland, might have worn
    That ornament, unblamed. The floweret, held
    In scarcely conscious fingers, was, she knows,
    (Her Father told her so) in youth gay dawn                      
    Her Mother favourite; and the orphan Girl,
    In her own dawn--a dawn less gay and bright,
    Loves it, while there in solitary peace
    She sits, for that departed Mother sake.
    --Not from a source less sacred is derived                        
    (Surely I do not err) that pensive air
    Of calm abstraction through the face diffused
    And the whole person.
                          Words have something told
    More than the pencil can, and verily
    More than is needed, but the precious Art                         
    Forgives their interference Art divine,
    That both creates and fixes, in despite
    Of Death and Time, the marvels it hath wrought.

      Strange contrasts have we in this world of ours!
    That posture, and the look of filial love                         
    Thinking of past and gone, with what is left
    Dearly united, might be swept away
    From this fair Portrait fleshly Archetype,
    Even by an innocent fancy slightest freak
    Banished, nor ever, haply, be restored                           
    To their lost place, or meet in harmony
    So exquisite; but _here_ do they abide,
    Enshrined for ages. Is not then the Art
    Godlike, a humble branch of the divine,
    In visible quest of immortality,                                  
    Stretched forth with trembling hope?--In every realm,
    From high Gibraltar to Siberian plains,
    Thousands, in each variety of tongue
    That Europe knows, would echo this appeal;
    One above all, a Monk who waits on God                            
    In the magnific Convent built of yore
    To sanctify the Escurial palace. He--
    Guiding, from cell to cell and room to room,
    A British Painter (eminent for truth
    In character, and depth of feeling, shown                     
    By labours that have touched the hearts of kings,
    And are endeared to simple cottagers)--
    Came, in that service, to a glorious work,
    Our Lord Last Supper, beautiful as when first
    The appropriate Picture, fresh from Titian hand,               
    Graced the Refectory: and there, while both
    Stood with eyes fixed upon that masterpiece,
    The hoary Father in the Stranger ear
    Breathed out these words Here daily do we sit,
    Thanks given to God for daily bread, and here                    
    Pondering the mischiefs of these restless times,
    And thinking of my Brethren, dead, dispersed,
    Or changed and changing, I not seldom gaze
    Upon this solemn Company unmoved
    By shock of circumstance, or lapse of years,                     
    Until I cannot but believe that they--
    They are in truth the Substance, we
    the Shadows

      So spake the mild Jeronymite, his griefs
    Melting away within him like a dream
    Ere he had ceased to gaze, perhaps to speak:                     
    And I, grown old, but in a happier land,
    Domestic Portrait! have to verse consigned
    In thy calm presence those heart-moving words:
    Words that can soothe, more than they agitate;
    Whose spirit, like the angel that went down                      
    Into Bethesda pool, with healing virtue
    Informs the fountain in the human breast
    Which by the visitation was disturbed.
    ----But why this stealing tear? Companion mute,
    On thee I look, not sorrowing; fare thee well,                   
    My Song Inspirer, once again farewell!
