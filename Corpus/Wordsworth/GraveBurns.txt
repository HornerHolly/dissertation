 I shiver, Spirit fierce and bold,
  At thought of what I now behold:
  As vapours breathed from dungeons cold
      Strike pleasure dead,
  So sadness comes from out the mould                     
      Where Burns is laid.

  And have I then thy bones so near,
  And thou forbidden to appear?
  As if it were thyself that's here
      I shrink with pain;                                    
  And both my wishes and my fear
      Alike are vain.
  
  Off weight--nor press on weight!--away
  Dark thoughts!--they came, but not to stay;
  With chastened feelings would I pay                        
      The tribute due
  To him, and aught that hides his clay
      From mortal view.

  Fresh as the flower, whose modest worth
  He sang, his genius "glinted" forth,
  Rose like a star that touching earth,
      For so it seems,
  Doth glorify its humble birth
      With matchless beams.

  The piercing eye, the thoughtful brow,                     
  The struggling heart, where be they now?--
  Full soon the Aspirant of the plough,
      The prompt, the brave,
  Slept, with the obscurest, in the low
      And silent grave.                                      

  I mourned with thousands, but as one
  More deeply grieved, for He was gone
  Whose light I hailed when first it shone,
      And showed my youth 
  How Verse may build a princely throne                      
      On humble truth.

  Alas! where'er the current tends,
  Regret pursues and with it blends,--
  Huge Criffel's hoary top ascends
      By Skiddaw seen,--
  Neighbours we were, and loving friends
      We might have been;

  True friends though diversely inclined;
  But heart with heart and mind with mind,
  Where the main fibres are entwined,                        
      Through Nature's skill,
  May even by contraries be joined
      More closely still.

  The tear will start, and let it flow;
  Thou "poor Inhabitant below,"
  At this dread moment--even so--
      Might we together
  Have sate and talked where gowans blow,
      Or on wild heather.

  What treasures would have then been placed                 
  Within my reach; of knowledge graced
  By fancy what a rich repast!
      But why go on?--
  Oh! spare to sweep, thou mournful blast,
      His grave grass-grown.                                 

  There, too, a Son, his joy and pride,
  (Not three weeks past the Stripling died,)
  Lies gathered to his Father's side,
      Soul-moving sight!
  Yet one to which is not denied                             
      Some sad delight.

  For _he_ is safe, a quiet bed
  Hath early found among the dead,
  Harboured where none can be misled,
      Wronged, or distrest;                                  
  And surely here it may be said
      That such are blest.

  And oh for Thee, by pitying grace
  Checked oft-times in a devious race,
  May He who halloweth the place                             
      Where Man is laid
  Receive thy Spirit in the embrace
      For which it prayed!

  Sighing I turned away; but ere
  Night fell I heard, or seemed to hear,                     
  Music that sorrow comes not near,
      A ritual hymn,
  Chanted in love that casts out fear
      By Seraphim.
