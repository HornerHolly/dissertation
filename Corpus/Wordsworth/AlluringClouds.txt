  The most alluring clouds that mount the sky
    Owe to a troubled element their forms,
    Their hues to sunset. If with raptured eye
    We watch their splendour, shall we covet storms,
    And wish the Lord of day his slow decline                          
    Would hasten, that such pomp may float on high?
    Behold, already they forget to shine,
    Dissolve and leave to him who gazed a sigh.
    Not loth to thank each moment for its boon
    Of pure delight, come whensoeer it may,                     
    Peace let us seek to stedfast things attune
    Calm expectations, leaving to the gay
    And volatile their love of transient bowers,
    The house that cannot pass away be ours.
