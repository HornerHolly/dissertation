Homeward we turn. Isle of Columba's Cell,
    Where Christian piety's soul-cheering spark
    (Kindled from Heaven between the light and dark
    Of time) shone like the morning-star, farewell!--
    And fare thee well, to Fancy visible,                             
    Remote St. Kilda, lone and loved sea-mark
    For many a voyage made in her swift bark,
    When with more hues than in the rainbow dwell
    Thou a mysterious intercourse dost hold,
    Extracting from clear skies and air serene,                       
    And out of sun-bright waves, a lucid veil,
    That thickens, spreads, and, mingling fold with fold,
    Makes known, when thou no longer canst be seen,
    Thy whereabout, to warn the approaching sail.
