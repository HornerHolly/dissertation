  Ye vales and hills whose beauty hither drew
    The poet’s steps, and fixed him here, on you,
    His eyes have closed! And ye, lov’d books, no more
    Shall Southey feed upon your precious lore,
    To works that ne’er shall forfeit their renown                     
    Adding immortal labours of his own--
    Whether he traced historic truth, with zeal
    For the State’s guidance, or the Church’s weal,
    Or Fancy, disciplined by studious art,
    Inform’d his pen, or wisdom of the heart,                         
    Or judgments sanctioned in the Patriot’s mind
    By reverence for the rights of all mankind.
    Wide were his aims, yet in no human breast
    Could private feelings meet for holier rest.
    His joys, his griefs, have vanished like a cloud                  
    From Skiddaw’s top; but he to heaven was vowed
    Through his industrious life, and Christian faith
    Calmed in his soul the fear of change and death.
