 Blest is this Isle--our native Land;
    Where battlement and moated gate
    Are objects only for the hand
    Of hoary Time to decorate;
    Where shady hamlet, town that breathes                             
    Its busy smoke in social wreaths,
    No rampart's stern defence require,
    Nought but the heaven-directed spire,
    And steeple tower (with pealing bells
    Far-heard)--our only citadels.                                    

    O Lady! from a noble line
    Of chieftains sprung,who stoutly bore
    The spear, yet gave to works divine
    A bounteous help in days of yore,
    (As records mouldering in the Dell                                
    Of Nightshade haply yet may tell;)
    Thee kindred aspirations moved
    To build, within a vale beloved,
    For Him upon whose high behests
    All peace depends, all safety rests.                              

    How fondly will the woods embrace
    This daughter of thy pious care,
    Lifting her front with modest grace
    To make a fair recess more fair;
    And to exalt the passing hour;                                    
    Or soothe it with a healing power
    Drawn from the Sacrifice fulfilled,
    Before this rugged soil was tilled,
    Or human habitation rose
    To interrupt the deep repose!

    Well may the villagers rejoice!
    Nor heat, nor cold, nor weary ways,
    Will be a hindrance to the voice
    That would unite in prayer and praise;
    More duly shall wild wandering Youth                              
    Receive the curb of sacred truth,
    Shall tottering Age, bent earthward, hear
    The Promise, with uplifted ear;
    And all shall welcome the new ray
    Imparted to their sabbath-day.                                    

                                   
    Nor deem the Poet's hope misplaced,
    His fancy cheated--that can see
    A shade upon the future cast,
    Of time's pathetic sanctity;
    Can hear the monitory clock                                       
    Sound o'er the lake with gentle shock
    At evening, when the ground beneath
    Is ruffled o'er with cells of death;
    Where happy generations lie,
    Here tutored for eternity.                                        


    Lives there a man whose sole delights
    Are trivial pomp and city noise,
    Hardening a heart that loathes or slights
    What every natural heart enjoys?
    Who never caught a noon-tide dream                                
    From murmur of a running stream;
    Could strip, for aught the prospect yields
    To him, their verdure from the fields;
    And take the radiance from the clouds
    In which the sun his setting shrouds.


    A soul so pitiably forlorn,
    If such do on this earth abide,
    May season apathy with scorn,
    May turn indifference to pride;
    And still be not unblest--compared                                
    With him who grovels, self-debarred
    From all that lies within the scope
    Of holy faith and christian hope;
    Or, shipwreck'd, kindles on the coast
    False fires, that others may be lost.

    Alas! that such perverted zeal
    Should spread on Britain's favoured ground!
    That public order, private weal,
    Should e'er have felt or feared a wound
    From champions of the desperate law                               
    Which from their own blind hearts they draw;
    Who tempt their reason to deny
    God, whom their passions dare defy,
    And boast that they alone are free
    Who reach this dire extremity!                                    

    But turn we from these "bold bad" men;
    The way, mild Lady! that hath led
    Down to their "dark opprobrious den,"
    Is all too rough for Thee to tread.
    Softly as morning vapours glide                                  
    Down Rydal-cove from Fairfield's side,
    Should move the tenor of _his_ song
    Who means to charity no wrong;
    Whose offering gladly would accord
    With this day's work, in thought and word.                        

    Heaven prosper it! may peace, and love,
    And hope, and consolation, fall,
    Through its meek influence, from above,
    And penetrate the hearts of all;
    All who, around the hallowed Fane,                               
    Shall sojourn in this fair domain;
    Grateful to Thee, while service pure,
    And ancient ordinance, shall endure,
    For opportunity bestowed
    To kneel together, and adore their God!
