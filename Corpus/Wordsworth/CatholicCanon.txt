    Doomed as we are our native dust
    To wet with many a bitter shower,
    It ill befits us to disdain
    The altar, to deride the fane,
    Where simple Sufferers bend, in trust                     
    To win a happier hour.

    I love, where spreads the village lawn,
    Upon some knee-worn cell to gaze:
    Hail to the firm unmoving cross,
    Aloft, where pines their branches toss!                       
    And to the chapel far withdrawn,
    That lurks by lonely ways!

    Where'er we roam--along the brink
    Of Rhine--or by the sweeping Po,
    Through Alpine vale, or champain wide,                    
    Whate'er we look on, at our side
    Be Charity!--to bid us think,
    And feel, if we would know.
