   They who have seen the noble Roman scorn
    Break forth at thought of laying down his head,
    When the blank day is over, garreted
    In his ancestral palace, where, from morn
    To night, the desecrated floors are worn                           
    By feet of purse-proud strangers; they who have read
    In one meek smile, beneath a peasant shed,
    How patiently the weight of wrong is borne;
    They who have heard some learned Patriot treat
    Of freedom, with mind grasping the whole theme                    
    From ancient Rome, downwards through that bright dream
    Of Commonwealths, each city a starlike seat
    Of rival glory; they fallen Italy
    Nor must, nor will, nor can, despair of Thee!
