  Ambition--following down this far-famed slope
    Her Pioneer, the snow-dissolving Sun,
    While clarions prate of kingdoms to be won--
    Perchance, in future ages, here may stop;
    Taught to mistrust her flattering horoscope                    
    By admonition from this prostrate Stone!
    Memento uninscribed of Pride o'erthrown;
    Vanity's hieroglyphic; a choice trope
    In Fortune's rhetoric. Daughter of the Rock,
    Rest where thy course was stayed by Power divine!
    The Soul transported sees, from hint of thine,                
    Crimes which the great Avenger's hand provoke,
    Hears combats whistling o'er the ensanguined heath:
    What groans! what shrieks! what quietness in death!
