 Presentiments! they judge not right
    Who deem that ye from open light
      Retire in fear of shame;
    All _heaven-born_ Instincts shun the touch
    Of vulgar sense,--and, being such,                                 
      Such privilege ye claim.

    The tear whose source I could not guess,
    The deep sigh that seemed fatherless,
      Were mine in early days;
    And now, unforced by time to part                                 
    With fancy, I obey my heart,
      And venture on your praise.

    What though some busy foes to good,
    Too potent over nerve and blood,
      Lurk near you--and combine                                      
    To taint the health which ye infuse;
    This hides not from the moral Muse
      Your origin divine.

    How oft from you, derided Powers!
    Comes Faith that in auspicious hours                              
      Builds castles, not of air:
    Bodings unsanctioned by the will
    Flow from your visionary skill,
      And teach us to beware.

    The bosom-weight, your stubborn gift,                             
    That no philosophy can lift,
      Shall vanish, if ye please,
    Like morning mist: and, where it lay,
    The spirits at your bidding play
      In gaiety and ease.                                             

    Star-guided contemplations move
    Through space, though calm, not raised above
      Prognostics that ye rule;
    The naked Indian of the wild,
    And haply, too, the cradled Child,                                
      Are pupils of your school.

    But who can fathom your intents,
    Number their signs or instruments?
      A rainbow, a sunbeam,
    A subtle smell that Spring unbinds,                               
    Dead pause abrupt of midnight winds,
      An echo, or a dream.

    The laughter of the Christmas hearth
    With sighs of self-exhausted mirth
      Ye feelingly reprove;                                           
    And daily, in the conscious breast,
    Your visitations are a test
      And exercise of love.

    When some great change gives boundless scope
    To an exulting Nation's hope,                                     
      Oft, startled and made wise
    By your low-breathed interpretings,
    The simply-meek foretaste the springs
      Of bitter contraries.

    Ye daunt the proud array of war,                                  
    Pervade the lonely ocean far
      As sail hath been unfurled;
    For dancers in the festive hall
    What ghastly partners hath your call
      Fetched from the shadowy world.                                 

    'Tis said, that warnings ye dispense,
    Emboldened by a keener sense;
      That men have lived for whom,
    With dread precision, ye made clear
    The hour that in a distant year                                   
      Should knell them to the tomb.

    Unwelcome insight! Yet there are
    Blest times when mystery is laid bare,
      Truth shows a glorious face,
    While on that isthmus which commands                              
    The councils of both worlds, she stands,
      Sage Spirits! by your grace.

    God, who instructs the brutes to scent
    All changes of the element,
      Whose wisdom fixed the scale                                    
    Of natures, for our wants provides
    By higher, sometimes humbler, guides,
      When lights of reason fail.
