 Bishops and Priests, blessed are ye, if deep
    (As yours above all offices is high)
    Deep in your hearts the sense of duty lie;
    Charged as ye are by Christ to feed and keep
    From wolves your portion of his chosen sheep:
    Labouring as ever in your Master's sight,
    Making your hardest task your best delight,
    What perfect glory ye in Heaven shall reap!--
    But, in the solemn Office which ye sought
    And undertook premonished, if unsound                             
    Your practice prove, faithless though but in thought,
    Bishops and Priests, think what a gulf profound
    Awaits you then, if they were rightly taught
    Who framed the Ordinance by your lives disowned!
