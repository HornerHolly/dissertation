 Through Cumbrian wilds, in many a mountain cove,
    The pastoral Muse laments the Wheel--no more
    Engaged, near blazing hearth on clean-swept floor,
    In tasks which guardian Angels might approve,
    Friendly the weight of leisure to remove,                          
    And to beguile the lassitude of ease;
    Gracious to all the dear dependencies
    Of house and field,--to plenty, peace, and love.
    There too did _Fancy_ prize the murmuring wheel;
    For sympathies, inexplicably fine,                                
    Instilled a confidence--how sweet to feel!
    That ever in the night-calm, when the Sheep
    Upon their grassy beds lay couchâ€™d in sleep,
    The quickening spindle drew a trustier line.
