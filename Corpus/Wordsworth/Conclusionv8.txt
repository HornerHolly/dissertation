 Yes, though He well may tremble at the sound
    Of his own voice, who from the judgment-seat
    Sends the pale Convict to his last retreat
    In death; though Listeners shudder all around,
    They know the dread requital’s source profound;                   
    Nor is, they feel, its wisdom obsolete--
    (Would that it were!) the sacrifice unmeet
    For Christian Faith. But hopeful signs abound;
    The social rights of man breathe purer air;
    Religion deepens her preventive care;                            
    Then, moved by needless fear of past abuse,
    Strike not from Law’s firm hand that awful rod,
    But leave it thence to drop for lack of use:
    Oh, speed the blessed hour, Almighty God!
