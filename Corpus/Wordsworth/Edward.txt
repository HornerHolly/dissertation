  "Sweet is the holiness of Youth"--so felt
    Time-honoured Chaucer speaking through that Lay
    By which the Prioress beguiled the way,
    And many a Pilgrim's rugged heart did melt.
    Hadst thou, loved Bard! whose spirit often dwelt                   
    In the clear land of vision, but foreseen
    King, child, and seraph, blended in the mien
    Of pious Edward kneeling as he knelt
    In meek and simple infancy, what joy
    For universal Christendom had thrilled                            
    Thy heart! what hopes inspired thy genius, skilled
    (O great Precursor, genuine morning Star)
    The lucid shafts of reason to employ,
    Piercing the Papal darkness from afar!
