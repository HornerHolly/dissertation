Dishonoured Rock and Ruin! that, by law
    Tyrannic, keep the Bird of Jove embarred
    Like a lone criminal whose life is spared.
    Vexed is he, and screams loud. The last I saw
    Was on the wing; stooping, he struck with awe                     
    Man, bird, and beast; then, with a consort paired,
    From a bold headland, their loved aery's guard,
    Flew high above Atlantic waves, to draw
    Light from the fountain of the setting sun.
    Such was this Prisoner once; and, when his plumes
    The sea-blast ruffles as the storm comes on,                      
    Then, for a moment, he, in spirit, resumes
    His rank 'mong freeborn creatures that live free,
    His power, his beauty, and his majesty.
