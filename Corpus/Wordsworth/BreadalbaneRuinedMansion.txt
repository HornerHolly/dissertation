    Well sang the Bard who called the grave, in strains
    Thoughtful and sad, the "narrow house." No style
    Of fond sepulchral flattery can beguile
    Grief of her sting; nor cheat, where he detains
    The sleeping dust, stern Death. How reconcile                      
    With truth, or with each other, decked remains
    Of a once warm Abode, and that _new_ Pile,
    For the departed, built with curious pains
    And mausolean pomp? Yet here they stand
    Together,--'mid trim walks and artful bowers,                     
    To be looked down upon by ancient hills,
    That, for the living and the dead, demand
    And prompt a harmony of genuine powers;
    Concord that elevates the mind, and stills.
