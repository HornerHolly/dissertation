 "Action is transitory--a step, a blow,                   
    The motion of a muscle--this way or that--
    'Tis done; and in the after-vacancy
    We wonder at ourselves like men betrayed:
    Suffering is permanent, obscure and dark,
    And has the nature of infinity.                            
    Yet through that darkness (infinite though it seem
    And irremovable) gracious openings lie,
    By which the soul--with patient steps of thought
    Now toiling, wafted now on wings of prayer--
    May pass in hope, and, though from mortal bonds             
    Yet undelivered, rise with sure ascent
    Even to the fountain-head of peace divine."
