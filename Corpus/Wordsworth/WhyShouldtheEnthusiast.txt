Why should the Enthusiast, journeying through this Isle,
    Repine as if his hour were come too late?
    Not unprotected in her mouldering state,
    Antiquity salutes him with a smile,
    Mid fruitful fields that ring with jocund toil,                   
    And pleasure-grounds where Taste, refined Co-mate
    Of Truth and Beauty, strives to imitate,
    Far as she may, primeval Natures style.
    Fair Land! by Time's parental love made free,
    By Social Orders watchful arms embraced;                         
    With unexampled union meet in thee,
    For eye and mind, the present and the past;
    With golden prospect for futurity,
    If that be reverenced which ought to last.
