# Work Log

    - Thursday, 1/22 (3:00pm-4:30pm): re-organized metadata
    - Friday, 1/23 (8:30am-10:00am): gathered all plain text versions of poem; did light cleaning.
    - Monday, 1/25 (7:30am-11:00am): finished cleaning poems and separating them into different plain text files.

# Exercise Description

I cleaned my corpus files to prepare publishing them into an open format on Github.

# Phase I

I downloaded the plaintext files of my volumes from HathiTrust. I manually omited liscencing information, chapter/volume headers, editoral footnotes, and other paratextual materials because my project is solely focused on word frequencies of the actual poems.

# Phase II 
I then used Regrex101 for light cleaning. I cleaned up errant punctuation (/[[:punct:]]), and tighten up general formatting. I think I figured out how to get rid of the long s. I used /[ſ]/gm with the function “substitution” to replace the long s symbol [ſ] with a traditional s. I used the same function to remove other recurrant errors as well.

# Phase III

I continued the final cleaning process by omiting stragling letters like /s/ and /d/, which were relics from the deleted apostrophes for possessives and contractions like "Heaven's" or "leap'd." I did this using the find and replace function in SublimeText.
