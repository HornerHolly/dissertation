# DH GRAVEYARDS: THE AFTERLIVES OF DIGITAL PROJECTS

As many anxious Ph.D. Candidates know, the dissertation’s manuscript clearance process is a trial in and of itself. There are a myriad of formatting and citation guidelines that must be followed to the letter. A submitted manuscript that fails to meet these expectations, as sternly stated under Florida State University’s Manuscript Clearance Information, “will NOT be reviewed and will NOT be considered as an initial submission to meet any deadline.” The manuscript clearance process’s enforcement of such deadlines and guidelines intends to prepare each dissertation for its “eternal” rest as a digital record in DigiNole’s “Research Repository,” which houses graduate theses and dissertations, undergraduate honor theses, and faculty publications.  Upon successfully completing one’s oral defense and overcoming the manuscript clearance process’s various hurdles, the dissertation is made digitally available on DigiNole where it will remain preserved like museum display for future viewers. 
	But what does this mean for the preservation of online digital objects, such as my website and data visualizations, that cannot be housed within the confines of a Microsoft Word Document or PDF?  Digital and physical text-objects like the dissertation manuscript have a system in place to maintain them through the university library, but this infrastructure does not support online materials, such as my website and data visualizations.  
In other words, there’s life-support for dissertation manuscripts upheld by the university, whereas I am performing palliative care for my website and data visualizations on my own. For example, my mapping visualizations for chapters 2 and 3 that are hosted online by Shinyapps.io require constant attention on my end.  If they remain inactive for too long, they will go to “sleep” and become inaccessible from the front-end (see image below).

The easiest solution for this issue is to regularly check on link and revive the digital project if it falls back into a digital sleep; however, this is not always feasible due to the lack of womanpower and time. Unlike DigiNole’s digital repository of dissertation and thesis manuscripts that has a whole team of people dedicated to keeping the site up and running, my online maps only have a single user to keep them alive: me. As proud as I am of these maps, I do not want to spend the rest of my life maintaining them. 
	Other creators of digital dissertation projects have run into the same issue. Amanda Visconti’s Infinite Ulysses project for creating a crowd-sourced annotated edition of Joyce’s Ulysses is no longer active. It remains as a static, digital object that “is an archival non-interactive version of the Infinite Ulysses project.”  This archived website acts as a digital tombstone for the original collaborative project, even bearing its short “lifespan” typed under the site updates: “March 2015-May 2016.” 
	Although Visconti’s project is perhaps the most famous in DH circles, it is not the only digital project that reached its natural lifespan. Other digital works experienced a less dignified digital death than being “archived” and are reincarnated into the dreaded “404: Page Not Found” error. It’s only a matter of time before many digital scholarly projects become inaccessible. This could be for any number of reasons: 1) the project has reached a natural conclusion, 2) the creator no longer maintains it, and/or 3) the technology behind the project’s creation is no longer supported.
 Back in the Spring of 2018, I was asked to compile a list of DH projects about Romanticism for Dr. Judith Pascoe. One such resource I found was a database of digital projects concerning Romanticism by Alan Liu that, at the time, was a robust repository of information and had all functional links.  The resources he provided ranged from indexes, digital editions, chronologies, to digital archives. Out of curiosity, I returned to that catalog on February 17, 2022 to see which of the listed projects were no longer among the living. Due to the sheer scale of this database, I limited my search to the first section entitled “General Resources in Romanticism.” Out of the ten resources for this section, seven of them are now considered defunct projects. This graveyard of broken links illustrates digital projects’ relatively short lifespans (Table 8). 
## Graveyard of Broken Links

| Site  | Creator(s)  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| 19th Century British and Irish Authors  | Mitsuharu Matsuoka, Nagoya U., Japan  | listed chronologically by birth date with links to related web resources  |
|  Acrostics of Self-Inscription by Women Poets of the Romantic Age | Stuart Curran, U. Penn   | acrostic poems by Elizabeth Caselli, Frances O'Neill, and Susannah Harrison  |
| The British Abolition Movement  | Mark Aronowitz, Miami U.  |site on the abolition of both slavery and the slave trade in Britain at the end of the eighteenth, beginning of the nineteenth centuries   |
| The Bijou  | Laura Mandell, Miami U.  | gift book of Romantic poetry and prose published in 1828, London  |
| British Poetry 1780-1910: a Hypertext Archive of Scholarly Editions   | Electronic Text Center, U. Virginia   |  N/A |
| British Sensation Fiction  | Michael E. Grost  | from Guide to Classic Mystery and Detection site  |
| British Women Romantic Poets, 1789-1832: An Electronic Collection of Texts  | Gen. Ed., Nancy Kushigian, UC Davis  | E-text editions of poetry by British and Irish women written [not necessarily published] between 1789 [the onset of the French Revolution] and 1832 [the passage of the Reform Act]  |


On one hand, I admire Liu’s ambitious database. At one point, it had a wealth of information that I would have happily referred to my undergraduate students. On the other, I recognize that its information has an expiration date. This dual-sided dilemma is applicable to all digital objects on the internet. So, why bother create digital projects that are not feasible to preserve long-term? I would counter this question with another: why not? Although the platform will eventually expire, that doesn’t mean that the information provided is invaluable. During their heyday, these digital projects functioned as intended and distributed information accordingly. The same could be said for physical, ephemeral objects, such as magazines, and newspapers. The few digital projects that survive past their natural end can be viewed in a state of suspended animation, like Visconti’s Infinite Ulysses Project.
Will my project’s website be one of these archival objects? Probably not. One day, someone is going to stumble upon my dissertation’s website and try to access the mapping visualizations for chapters 2 and 3, only to be brought to a “404: page not found” error. It will, however, survive through references and screenshots in my digitized dissertation.
