# Work Log

    - Monday, 3/8 (8:30am-11:00am)

# Exercise Description

I worked on mapping through basic text-mining in Topic Modeling.

# Sample Corpus
I used the Beachy Head plaintext files for this experiment. I used 13 separate plaintext files for each poem for this exercise. See below for the Metadata table:

# Refence Models

Based on the rough topic modeling of the 13 provided poems, I believe I need to run more poems through this topic modeling exercise to generate any thing noteworthy. Out of the 10 provided models, I believe Model # 3, and #8 have the most unified themes. Model # 3 could be labled as sentimental discourse and Model #8 seemst to be linked to oceanic landscapes and imperialism, which could be a connection to the British Navy. However, the natural themes and images are scattered pretty consistently across the generated topics.

# Next Steps
* I still need to work on cleaning up my corpus further.
