# Work Log

    - Thursday, 2/4 (10:00-11:00am): spent way too much time trying to install OpenRefine. Spoiler alert: don't use Firefox.
    - Monday, 2/8 (8:40-9:00am; 9:05-10:00am; 11:00-11:30am): experimented with Open Refine and Breve; installed RStudio packages; attended workshop on Github Desktop.

# Exercise Description

I uploaded my Metadata CSV file to OpenRefine. For the sake of experimenting with the tool as intended, I faceted poems that were not categorized as sonnets (indicated as N/A for Sonnet Number). In total, there are 40 non-sonnets in my corpus. I then loaded this shortened csv file into Breve to "see my data" transformed into a quick visual.

I also got ahead on the Healy reading and installed/played with some of his recommended packagest for RStudio.

# Observations

    OpenRefine seems to be more helpful for projects with messier data than mine.
    At this stage, Breve doesn't really show much for my data. I would be more interested in trying this tool once I've compiled my word frequencies in R. It would be interesting to compare Breve's visual with the visual packages in R.
