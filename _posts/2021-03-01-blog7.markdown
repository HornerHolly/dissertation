# Work Log

    - Monday, 2/22 (9:00am-12:30pm): practiced Healy's R code; attended lab hours
    - Tuesday, 2/23 (10:00am-11:00am): adjusted my visuals to be tidy.

# R Code for Graphs
##Clear workspace


```
rm()
```

## Library


```
library(tidyverse) library (gapminder) library(scales)
```

## Mapping With ggplot


```
p<- ggplot(data = exercise6parts, mapping =aes(x = Word, y = Frequency))

p + geom_point(alpha= 0.3) + geom_smooth(method= "gam")+

labs(x = "Word", y = "Frequency", title = "Word Frequencies in Charlotte Smith's Poetry", subtitle = "Top 20 words", caption = "Source: HathiTrust.
```
")
## The visual

# Questions

    - How can I map a random selection of data?
    - How do I intergrate the visual directly into Github without copying a link?
