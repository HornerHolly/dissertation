# Why map literature?

A critical trend among DH scholars interested in mapping is to ask the overarching question: why map literature? Randa El Khatib and Marcel Schaeben undertakes this question in their article on their process of “building ‘A Map of Paradise Lost’ through “text-to-map” visualization that traces locatable places in Milton’s classic text. In terms of visual representation, this project is something I would like to emulate in future iterations of my Smith chapter. In addition to creating a mapping visualization, the authors also argue for why mapping literature is a necessary and illuminating process. They argue that “Digital projects can blur the boundaries that separate different scholarly genres and produce hybrids that amalgamate different elements,” which allows for new critical insight about a text.([^Bignote]: Randa El Khatib and Marcel Schaeben, “Why Map Literature? Geospatial Prototyping for Literary Studies and Digital Humanities,” Digital Studies 10, no. 1 (2020), n.p. Although this article was later “retracted” for being accidentally published as an earlier draft with data errors, it still offers a meaningful discussion of the affordances and constraints of digital mapping projects in the humanities. ) Essentially, a digital project that transforms a collection of texts becomes its own scholarly edition or text that invites readers to approach the original topic from a new angle. 

One such example of how mapping can transform a collection of texts “Mapping Travel Writing: A Digital Humanities Project to Visualise Change in Nineteenth-Century Published Travel Texts.” Belgum et al.’s project uses data mapping and data visualization to better understand travel writing in the nineteenth-century. Their corpus was comprised of 3,000+ English book titles. They used “geoparsing,” a computational analysis tool recognizes place names from the book titles from their corpus, to generate their map. This project is immensely valuable for my work because it also argues for how mapping visualizations are enlightening tools for literary study. By restructuring the data away from the alphabetized bibliography structure, mapping tools foreground the geographic component of travel writing. 	

Jen Jack Gieseking also advocates for how mapping visualizations provide DH scholars meaningful ways to approach literary texts in “Where Are We? The Method of Mapping with GIS in Digital Humanities.” This article discusses “issues/possibilities” of “geographic information systems” in DH scholarship, specifically pertaining to American studies. Although the origins of GIS is located within American military and commercial operations, the software has evolved to become more user-friendly and more accessible for different types of scholars. ([^2]: Jen Jack Gieseking, “Where Are We? The Method of Mapping with GIS in Digital Humanities.,” American Quarterly 70, no. 3 (2018): 643.)    DH GIS scholars have an important role of disbanding the binary myth of quantitative and qualitative methods by “bridging the qualitative and quantitative divide.”   Gieseking’s assertion that DH GIS methods are necessary and important for the evolution of how scholars read and understand data visualizations in the humanities is central to my project’s goal.
	

# Charlotte Smith and space

This project closely interrogates the layering of physical and imaginary geography, time, and national identity in Charlotte Smith’s (1794-1806) Beachy Head. The intermingling of physical and imaginary geography and time appear to criticize the politics of French and British imperialism, which Smith further illuminates through her extensive footnoting. Scholars generally agree upon the significance of the Smith’s fusing landscape and time in this text—as eighteenth-century literature scholar Michael Wiley indicates, Beachy Head “addresses the geography of England and Europe…[and] the geography of the world and an extra-geographical, fanciful and visionary space” (Wiley, 2006: 64). Smith’s treatment of time and geography, I argue, draws upon the quintessential Romantic notion of “spots of time,” a phrase Wordsworth later writes in the Prelude (Wordsworth, 2008: 258-276). The moment where Smith reflects upon the “Haunts of [her] youth!” culminates with the intersection of the past, present, and imaginary, which also can be characterized as a spot of time. This instance demonstrates the interweaving of the geographical and temporal layers seen repeatedly throughout the poem: ranging from the present as the speaker gazes upon the Beachy Head rock formation, to the “vast concussion” as the British Isle separates from the mainland during antiquity and, finally, to the poet’s imaginings of a nameless shepherd (Smith, 2017: 163, 174). 


# Methods

For the purposes of this project, I refer to three distinct categories of time as Smith treats it in this text: 1) the present moment in the poem as narrated by the speaker, 2) the historical past, and 3) the atemporal, or imaginative, scenes of the pastoral that Smith locates outside of time itself. These temporal layers allow for Smith to simultaneously critique the consequences of the French Revolution outside and within Britain and to retreat from the current historical moment via spots of time. 
Building upon previous scholarship on Beachy Head, I use geo-coding to map the latitudes and longitudes of these actual and imagined locations to illustrate how Smith layers this complex of geography and time to construct a critique the French Revolution’s aftermath in Britain. This system was conducted in R (a programming language and software) through ggplot 2. Each unique place mentioned in Beachy Head counted as its own data-point and was assigned rough geographical coordinates. In the poem, Smith is quite clear with the general locations (i.e. she identifies Gallica, or modern France), but she does not always provide the precise geographical locations. Consequently, the coordinates I provided are speculative in nature and based on clues from the text. Although this project strives for geographical accuracy, it is impossible to accurately deduce all the specific locations Smith envisioned for this text. 


To  illustrate the tensions between space and time in *Beachy Head*, I mapped the present, past, and atemporal locations using ggplot 2 in R (a programming language and software). After identifying plottable locations and references present in the text, I located the geographical coordinates using Google Maps. Then, I consulted the online blog “Interactive Maps in R: Leaflet” for guidance on how to generate the map with multiple data-points, which was very helpful because the commands the creator used directed me to a pre-made world map and I did not have to generate one myself. The final product is a html format interactive global map with blue markers that demonstrates the locations referenced throughout the poem. It will be possible to zoom in and screen shot particular sections of the map for better visuals when necessary. Instead of only showing a global view of the map, I could, for example, narrow the focus just on the coast of England, the English Channel, and the coast of France. This flexibility will be helpful in the actual paper because I will be able to direct readers to screen shots of particular parts of the map. 




# Discussion
Although rendering visualizations of Romantic writings through mapping is not a new phenomenon, most scholars do not fully consider the relationship between temporality and space in these projects.  For instance, The Byron Online Project offers a different mapping endeavor on the British Romantics that tracks the frequency of named locations in Byron’s correspondence and in Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage Cantos I-II. This sort of project remains rooted in Byron’s contemporary historical reality and is a popular method for mapping the Romantics. The map from the Byron Online Project does perform important work for visualizing the relationship between these two types of writing, but it does not fully consider the relationship between time and space. This, in part, could be due to the difference between Byron’s and Smith’s personal writing agendas. 

Nevertheless, reading the spaces in Beachy Head in terms of temporality offers a new perspective of approaching Romantic texts. The temporal oscillation between past and present in the poem remains entrenched in the geographical location of Beachy Head itself as it stands representative of past and present threats of French invasion. In these moments, Smith critiques past and contemporary imperial ideology by invoking traumatic instances held in British national memory and detailing the effects of a global empire upon the rural individual. Then, through juxtaposing historical and pastoral landscapes, Smith moves away from the traumatic consequences of globalization and into the atemporal landscape of the pastoral. This temporal shift into the imaginary culminates in the spots of time, which allows Smith to distance herself geographically and imaginatively from the current political turmoil.


Although Smith is quite clear with the general locations (i.e. she identifies Gallica, or modern France), she does not always provide accurate information for the precise geographical location. As such, the coordinates I provided are speculative in nature and based on clues from the text. For example, Smith imaginatively paints the image of an Indian slave working on the coast (BH, 37-49), but does not offer suggestions for which Indian coast she envisions. The geo-coordinates I provided for this entry are based in modern Bombay (estimated at 18.347454, 73.05306) on the western coast of the Arabian Sea, but one could argue that an eastern Indian coast off the Bay of Bengal would have worked as well. Although this project strives for geographical accuracy, it is impossible to accurately deduce all the specific locations Smith envisioned for this text. Primarily, because Smith often invokes an individual to stand representative of a whole. The Indian slave standing on the coast, for Smith, remains synonymous for other slaves impacted by the wrath of imperialism and stands representative for all of India. Consequently, even though several of the imaginative locations from this project are speculative in nature, their rough geographical coordinate still illustrates the same point: Smith is using the real and imaginative local places to stand representative of the global.

# Next Steps
Although this mapping project on just Beachy Head reveals insightful observations regarding Smith's understanding of space in poetry, I intend to build and refine these methods further as I expand my search into all of the poems from *Beachy Head: with other poems* (1807), *Elegiac Sonnets and Other Poems, volumes I and II *(1797), and *The Emigrants: a poem in two volumes* (1793). I also intend to refine my visualizations readability by following the rules outlined in Healy's *Data Visualizations* guide.
