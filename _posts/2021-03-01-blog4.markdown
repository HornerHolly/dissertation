# Work Log

    - Thursday, 1/28 (9:00am-11:00am): spent too much time organizing Github.
    - Friday, 1/29 (9:00 am-12:00pm): fixed errors caused by omitting apostrophes.
    - Tuesday, 2/2 (7:30am-11:30am): reuploaded files to Github; formatted worklogs to document changes.

# Exercise Description
I continued cleaning up poem files and optimizing them to be placed on Github. I also considered the best way to break up my units of data for my project.

# File
My corpus is comprised of three volumes of Charlotte Smith's poetry with individual poems separated by volume.

# Line
Each plain text file is a single poem isolated to one line.

# Intermediate divisions
The only divisions I am concerned with are the divisions between individual poems and categorizing them within their original volume of poetry.

# Documentation
Detailed documentation for cleaning can be found under Exercise 3.
