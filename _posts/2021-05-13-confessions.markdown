# Confessions of Dissertating English Student 
*May 13, 2021*

The first question people ask about my dissertation is: what is your argument? It is a fairly standard, innocent question that I could answer three-minute-thesis style for any other project I’ve done in the past. My heart starts to race, and I usually have to take a deep breath, steeling myself for their looks of disbelief and confusion, before launching into my now canned and ready response: “I don’t know.”

The more accurate answer is actually “I don’t know—yet.” My dissertation is a strange amalgam of traditional literary scholarship (rigorously performing lots of research, reading all of the poems, close-reading said poems, and so on) and digital methods (text-mining analyses, mapping, and data visualizations). Unlike my peers in the social sciences, I don’t have a hypothesis to test, nor do I have clear, overarching literary argument about Romanticism. When pressed for further questions by confused colleagues, I further explain that my dissertation is an “experiment, sort of.” That classification might make folks from the harder sciences cringe because, technically, it’s not an experiment either. I’m not following the scientific method. I don’t have a control group and, to be even more candid, I only have a vague, fuzzy idea of those procedures from my high school biology class 12 years ago. 

When I classify my dissertation as an experiment, I am not referring to my digital methods, but rather how it challenges the genre of a traditional literary dissertation. I often joke with my loved ones that I could have written a standard English dissertation on gothic novels within half the time it has taken me to tackle this beast. It would have been easy: make a standard literary argument, throw in a dash of literary criticism and recent scholarship, and a healthy portion of close-reading. It would have been easy because that is what I’ve been trained for during my 10 years in college studying English literature. Instead, I decided to complicate things by taking the traditional literary scholarship route plus learning how to perform computational methods in the humanities. So, not only do I have to prove mastery in my field through thoughtful, traditional literary scholarship, but I also have to simultaneously defend my use of digital methods in an English Literature dissertation. Because of all this, I have to engage in metacommentary on the genre of a literary dissertation and how my project looks nothing like that, but why its existence and my endeavors are important for reshaping the expectations English literature dissertations. That’s a lot of pressure to put on one dissertation.

The fact that I need to engage in this metacommentary at all is a little frustrating because DH methods in English departments is not a new concept. The slew of articles defining and defending DH as a valid method of literary study is overwhelming and repetitive. Works circa 2011 like Matthew Kirschenbaum’s piece endeavored to define the area and simultaneously advocate for its value in academia.[&#x00b1;](#n1)   More recent scholarship like James Dobson’s Critical Digital Humanities: The Search for a Methodology creating a streamlined methodology for practicing DH methods in other disciplines, which further suggests the ongoing difficulty for understanding what DH is and how do we practice it.[&#x00b2;](#n2)  

During a computational methods course I audited in the Spring 2021, a colleague who works as one of their digital scholarship consultants in the library expressed his (rightful) exasperation about the genre of “What is DH?” essays. Why do we still see these types of articles when DH is now more established in educational institutions than ever? Who needs to still prove this? As the only English Department student in the class, I raised my hand and bleakly said, “Me.”

Despite being around for several decades, literary scholars who wish to step out of the ‘safe zone’ of the library, a beacon of DH ideology, with their own digital scholarship still have to contend with the “but, why?” question from their peers, dissertation committees, prospective employers, and even loved ones (hi, Mom). My own dissertation committee—a collective of the most supportive and enthusiastic scholars I’ve had the privilege of working with—even requires me to answer the same question. Not that they don’t believe in my work, but because they see the resolute institution of literary scholarship entrenched in its old ways. To put it bluntly, I need to make my flashy, DH skills palatable, understandable, and familiar to more traditional literary scholars so that I can make myself more marketable in competitive, oversaturated job market. 
I
n the last year, I’ve come to associate my dissertation and her (yes, I gendered my dissertation) lack of a cohesive argument (yet) with the instability and uncertainty of my future as a prospective PhD graduate. The second question I usually get from folks asking about my dissertation is, “What are you going to do with it?” My answer is the same as the first, “I don’t know—yet.” 

And you know what? That’s okay.
