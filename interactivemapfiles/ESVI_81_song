DOES Pity give  tho  Fate denies  And to my wounds her balm impart   O speak with those expre ive eyes   Let one low sigh escape thine heart  The gazing croud shall never gue  What anxious  watchful Love can see   Nor know what those soft looks expre   Nor dream that sigh is meant for me  Ah  words are usele   words are vain  Thy generous sympathy to prove   And well that sigh  those looks explain  That Clara mourns my haple  love
