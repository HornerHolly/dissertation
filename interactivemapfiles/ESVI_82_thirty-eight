In early youth unclouded scene  The brilliant morning of eighteen  With health and sprightly joy elate We gazed on life enchanting spring  Nor thought how quickly time would bring The mournful period Thirty eight  Then the starch maid  or matron sage  Already of that sober age  We view with mingled scorn and hate   In whose sharp words  or sharper face  With thoughtle  mirth we loved to trace The sad effects of Thirty eight Till faddening  fickening at the view  We learn to dread what Time might do   And then preferr a prayer to Fate To end our days ere that arrived   When  power and pleasure long survived  We met neglect and Thirty eight  But Time  in spite of wishes flies  And Fate our simple prayer denies  And bids us Death own hour await   The auburn locks are mix with grey  The transient roses fade away  But Reason comes at  Thirty eight  Her voice the anguish contradicts That dying vanity inflicts  Her hand new pleasures can create  For us she opens to the view Prospects le  bright but far more true  And bids us smile at  Thirty eight  No more shall Scandal breath destroy The social converse we enjoy With bard or critic tête à tête    O er Youth bright blooms her blights shall pour  But spare the improving friendly hour That Science gives to  Thirty eight  Stripp of their gaudy hues by Truth  We view the glitt ring toys of youth  And blush to think how poor the bait For which to public scenes we ran And scorn of sober Sense the plan Which gives content at  Thirty eight  Tho  Time inexorable sway Has torn the myrtle bands away  For other wreaths  tis not too late  The amaranth purple glow survives  And still Minerva olive lives On the calm brow of Thirty eight  With eye more steady we engage To contemplate approaching age  And life more justly estimate  With firmer souls  and stronger powers  With reason  faith  and friendship ours  We ll not regret the stealing hours That lead from Thirty  even to Forty eight
