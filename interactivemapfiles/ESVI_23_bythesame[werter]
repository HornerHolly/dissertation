 to thy bright beams I turn my swimming eyes  Fair  fav rite planet  which in happier days Saw my young hopes  ah  faithle  hopes     arise  And on my pa ion shed propitious rays   Now nightly wandering Ê¼mid the tempests drear That howl the woods and rocky steeps among  I love to see thy sudden light appear Thro  the swift clouds driven by the wind along   Or in the turbid water  rude and dark over whose wild stream the gust of Winter raves  Thy trembling light with pleasure still I mark  Gleam in faint radiance on the foaming waves   So over my soul short rays of reason fly  Then fade     and leave me to despair  and die
