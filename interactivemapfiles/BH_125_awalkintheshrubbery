 To the Cistus or Rock Rose  a beautiful plant  whose flowers expand  and fall off twice in twenty four hours  The Florists  who have fondly watch  Some curious bulb from hour to hour  And  to ideal charms attach  Derive their glory from a flower  Or they  who lose in crouded rooms  Spring  tepid suns and balmy air  And value Flora  fairest blooms  But in proportion as they re rare  Feel not the pensive pleasures known To him  who  thro  the morning mist  Explores the bowery shrubs new blown  A moralizing Botanist  He marks  with colours how profuse Some are design to please the eye  While beauty some combine with use  In admirable harmony  The fruit buds  shadow red and white  Amid young leaves of April hue  Convey sensations of delight  And promise fruits autumnal too  And  while the Thrush his home and food  Hails  as the flowering thorns unfold  And from its trunk of ebon wood  Rears Cytisus its floating gold  The Lilac  whose tall head discloses Groups of such bright empurpled shade  And snow globes form of elfin roses  Seem for exclusive beauty made   Such too art thou  when light anew Above the eastern hill is seen  Thy buds  as fearful of the dew  Still wear their sheltering veil of greet  But in the next more genial hour Thy tender rose shaped cups unfold  And soon appears the perfect flower  With ruby spots and threads of gold  That short and fleeting hour gone by  And even the slightest breath of air  Scarce heard among thy leaves to sigh  Or little bird that flutters there  Shakes off thy petals thin and frail  And soon  like half congealing snow  The sport of every wandering gale  They strew the humid turf below  Yet tho  thy gauzy bells fall fast  Long ere appears the evening crescent    Another bloom succeeds the last  As lovely and as evanescent  Not so the poet  favourite Rose  She blooms beyond a second day  And even some later beauty shews  Some charm still lingering in decay  Thus those  who thro  life  path have pa   A path how seldom strewn with flowers   Nay have met Friendships formed to last Beyond the noonday  golden hours While quickly formed  di olv as soon  Some warm attachments I have known Just flourish for an hour at noon  But leave no trace when overblown  Minds that form these  with ardent zeal Their new connexions fondly cherish  And for a moment keenly feel Affection  doomed as soon to perish  Incapable of Friendship long  Awake to every new impre ion  Old friends  becoming ci devant   Are still replaced by a Succe ion
