CLOUDs   gold and purple   over the westering ray
Threw a bright veil   and catching lights between  
Fell on the glancing sail   that we had seen
With soft   but adverse winds   throughout the day
Contending vainly   as the vessel nears  
Encreasing numbers hail it from the shore  
Lo   on the deck a pallid form appears  
Half wondering to behold himself once more
Approach his home And now he can discern
His cottage thatch amid surrounding trees   
Yet   trembling   dreads least sorrow or disease
Await him there   embittering his return   
But all he loves are safe   with heart elate  
Tho   poor and plundered   he absolves his fate
