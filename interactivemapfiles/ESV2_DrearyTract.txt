sWIFT fleet the billowy clouds along the sky  
Earth seems to shudder at the storm aghast   
While only beings as forlorn as I  
Court the chill horrors of the howling blast  
Even round yon crumbling walls   in search of food  
The ravenous Owl foregoes his evening flight  
And in his cave   within the deepest wood  
The Fox eludes the tempest of the night  
But to my heart congenial is the gloom
Which hides me from a World I wish to shun  
That scene where Ruin saps the mouldering tomb  
suits with the sadness of a wretch undone  
Nor is the deepest shade   the keenest air  
Black as my fate   or cold as my despair
