OH  place me where the burning noon Forbids the wither flower to blow  Or place me in the frigid zone  On mountains of eternal snow   Let me pursue the steps of Fame  Or Poverty more tranquil road   Let youth warm tide my veins inflame  Or fixty winters chill my blood   Tho  my fond soul to Heaven were flown  Or tho  on earth  tis doom to pine  Prisoner or free obscure or known  My heart  oh  Laura   still is thine  Whate er my destiny may be  That faithful heart still burns for thee
