Wyndham  tis not thy blood  tho  pure it runs Thro  a long line of glorious ancestry  Percys and Seymours  Britain boasted sons  Who trust the honors of their race to thee    Tis not thy splendid domes  where science loves To touch the canvas  and the bust to raise     Thy rich domains  fair fields  and spreading groves    Tis not all these the Muse delights to praise   In birth  and wealth  and honors  great thou art   But nobler in thy independent mind  And in that liberal hand and feeling heart Given thee by Heaven    a ble ing to mankind   Unworthy oft may titled fortune be  A foul like thine is true Nobility
