Remote from scenes  where the erwearied mind Shrinks from the crimes and follies of mankind  From hostile menace  and offensive boast  Peace  and her train of home born pleasures lost   To fancy  reign  who would not gladly turn  And lose awhile  the miseries they mourn In sweet oblivion  Come then  Fancy  deign  Queen of ideal pleasure  once again  To lend thy magic pencil  and to bring Such lovely forms  as in life  happier spring  On the green margin of my native Wey  Before mine infant eyes were wont to play  And with that pencil  teach me to describe The enchanting godde  of the flowery tribe  Whose first prerogative it is to chase The clouds that hang on languid beauty  face  And  while advancing suns and tepid showers  Lead on the laughing Spring  delicious hours  Bid the wan maid the hues of health a ume  Charm with new grace  and blush with fresher bloom  The vision comes  While slowly melt away  Night  hovering shades before the eastern ray  Ere yet declines the morning  humid star  Fair Fancy brings her  in her leafy car Flora descends  to dre  the expecting earth  Awake the germs  and call the buds to birth   Bid each hybernacle its cell unfold  And open silken leaves  and eyes of gold   Of forest foliage of the firmest shade Enwove by magic hands  the car was made   Oak  and the ample Plane  without entwined  And Beech and Ash the verdant concave lind  The Saxifrage  that snowy flowers embo   Supplied the seat  and of the mural mo  The velvet footstool rose  where lightly rest  Her slender feet in Cypripedium drest  The tufted rush  that bears a silken crown  The floating feathers of the thistle  down   In tender hues of rainbow lustre dyed  The airy texture of her robe supplied  And wild convolvuli  yet half unblown  Form  with their wreathing buds  her simple zone  Some wandering tre es of her radiant hair  Luxuriant floated on the enamour air  The rest were by the Scandix  points confin And graced a shining knot  her head behind While  as a sceptre of supreme command  She waved the Anthoxanthum in her hand  Around the godde   as the flies that play  In countle  myriads in the western ray  The sylphs innumerous throng  whose magic powers Guard the soft buds  and nurse the infant flowers   Round the sustaining stems weak tendrils bind  And save the pollen from dispersing wind  From suns too ardent  shade their transient hues  And catch in odorous cups translucent dews  The ruder tasks of others are  to chase From vegetable life the insect race  Break the polluting thread the spider weaves  And brush the aphis from th  unfolding leaves  For conquest arm these pigmy warriors wield The thorny lance  and spread the hollow shield Of lichen tough  or bear  as silver bright  Lunaria  pearly circlet  firm and light  On the helm head the crimson foxglove glows  Or Scutellaria guards the martial brows  While the Leontodon its plumage rears  And er the casque in waving grace appears   With stern undaunted eye  one warlike chief Grasps the tall club from Arum  blood dropt leaf   This  with the Burdock  hooks annoys his foes  The purple thorn that borrows from the Rose  In honeyed nectaries couched  some drive away The forked insidious earwig from his prey  Fearle  the scaled libellula a ail  Dart their keen lances at the encroaching snail   Arrest the winged ant  on pinions light  And strike the headlong beetle in his flight  Nor le  a iduous round their lovely queen  The lighter forms of female fays are seen    Rich was the purple vest Floscella wore  Spun of the tufts the Tradescantia bore  The Cistus  flowers minute her temple graced  And threads of Yucca bound her slender waist  From the wild bee  whose wond rous labour weaves  In artful folds the rose  fragrant leaves  Was borrow fair Petalla  light cymar  And the Hypericum  with spangling star  er her fair locks its bloom minute enwreath   Then  while voluptuous odours round her breath  1 1 Came Nectarynia  as the arrowy rays Of lambent fire round pictur seraphs blaze  So did the Pa iflora  radii shed  Cerulean glory er the sylphid  head  While round her form  the pliant tendrils twined  And clasp the scarf that floated on the wind  More grave the para nymph Calyxa drest  A brown transparent spatha formed her vest  The silver scales that bound her raven hair  Xeranthemum  unfading calyx bear  And a light sash of spiral Ophrys pre  Her filmy tunic  on her tender breast  But where shall images or words be found To paint the fair ethereal forms  that round The queen of flowers attended   and the while Bask in her eyes  and wanton in her smile  Now towards the earth the gay proce ion bends  Lo  from the buoyant air  the car descends   Anticipating then the various year  Flowers of all hues and every month appear  From every swelling bulb its blo oms rise   Here  blow the Hyacinths of loveliest dyes  Breathing of heaven  and there  her royal brows Begemrned with pearl  the Crown imperial shews  Peeps the blue Gentian  from the soft ning ground  Jonquils and Violets  shed their odours round  The Honeysuckle rears his scallop horn  A snow of blo oms whiten on the thorn  Here  like the fatal fruit to Paris given  That spread fell feuds throughout the fabled heaven  The yellow Rose her golden globe displays  There lovelier still  among the spiny sprays Her blushing rivals glow with brighter dyes  Than paints the summer sun on western skies  And the scarce tinged  and paler Rose unveil Their modest beauties to the sighing gale  Thro  the deep woodland  wild uncultur scene  Spreads the soft influence of the floral queen  See a fair pyramid the Chesnut rear  Its crimson ta els on the Larch appear   The Fir  dark native of the sullen North  Owns her soft sway  and slowly springing forth On the rough Oak are buds minute unfurld  Whose giant produce may command the world  Each forest thicket feels the balmy air  And plants that love the shade are blowing there  Rude rocks with Filices and Bryums smile  And wastes are gay with Thyme and Chamomile    Ah  yet prolong the dear delicious dream  And trace her power along the mountain stream  See  from its rude and rocky source  o erhung With female fern  and glo y adder  tongue Slowly it wells  in pure and chrystal drops  And steals soft gliding  thro  the upland copse  Then murmuring on  along the willowy sides  The reed bird whispers  and the Halcyon hides  While among sallows pale  and birchen bowers  Embarks in Fancy  eye the queen of flowers  er her light skiff  of woven bull rush made  The Water lily lends a polish shade   While Galium there  of pale and silver hue  And Epilobiums on the banks that grew  Form her soft couch  and as the Sylphs divide  With pliant arms  the still increasing tide  A thousand leaves along the stream unfold  Amid its waving swords  in flaming gold The Iris towers  and here the Arrowhead And water Crowfoot  more profusely spread Spangle the quiet current  higher there  As conscious of her claims  in beauty rare  Her rosy umbels rears the flow ring Rush  While with reflected charms the waters blush  The naiad now  the year  fair godde  leads  Through richer pastures and more level meads Down to the sea  where even the briny sands Their product offer to her glowing hands  For there  by sea dews nurs and airs marine  The Chelidonium blows  in glaucous green  Each refluent tide the thorn Eryngium laves  And its pale leaves seem tinctured by the waves   And half way up the cliff  whose rugged brow Hangs er the ever toiling surge below  Springs the light Tamarisk  The summit bare  Is tufted by the Statice  and there  Crush by the fisher  as he stands to mark Some distant signal or approaching baik  The Saltwort  starry stalks are thickly sown  Like humble worth  unheeded and unknown   From depths where corals spring from chrystal caves  And break with scarlet branch  the eddying waves  Where Alg√¶ stream  as change the flowing tides  And where  half flower  half fish  the Polyp hides  And long tenacious bands of sea lace twine Round palm shaped leaves impearld with coralline  Enamour Fancy now the sea maids calls  And from their grottos dim  and shell paved halls  Charm by her voice  the shining train emerge  And buoyant float above the circling surge   Green By us  waving in the sea born gales  Form their thin mantles  and transparent veils  Panier in shells  or bound with silver strings  Of silken pinna   each her trophy brings Of plants  from rocks and caverns submarine  With leathery branch  and bladder buds between   There  its dark folds the pucker laver spread  With trees in ininiature of various red   There flag shaped olive leaves  depending hung  And fairy fans from glo y pebbles sprung  Then her terrestrial train the nereids meet  And lay their spoils saline at Flora  feet   fairest of the fabled forms  that stream  Dre  by wild Fancy  thro  the poet  dream  Still may thy attributes of leaves and flowers  Thy garden  rich  and shrub ershadow bowers  And yellow meads  with Spring  first honours bright  The child  gay heart  and frolic step invite  And  while the carele  wanderer explores  The umbrageous forest  or the rugged shores  Climbs the green down  or roams the broom clad waste  May Truth  and Nature  form his future taste  Godde    on youth  ble  hours thy gifts bestow  Bind the fair wreath on virgin beauty  brow  And still may Fancy  brightest flowers be wove Round the gold chains of hymeneal love  But most for those  by Sorrow  hands oppre   May thy beds blo om  and thy wilds be dre   And where by Fortune and the world forgot  The mourner droops in some sequester spot    Sad luxury to vulgar minds unknown    er blighted happine  for ever gone  Yet the dear image seeks not to forget  But woos his grief  and cherishes regret   Loving  with fond and lingering pain  to mourn er joys and hopes that never will return    Thou  visionary power   mayst bid him view Forms not le  lovely  and as transient too   And while they soothe the wearied pilgrim  eyes  Afford an antepast of Paradise
