 ThoU spectre of terrific mein  Lord of the hopele  heart and hollow eye  In whose fierce train each form is seen That drives fick Reason to insanity  I woo thee with unusual prayer    Grim visaged  comfortle  Despair    Approach  in me a willing viá»‡tim find  Who seeks thine iron sway and calls thee kind   Ah  hide for ever from my sight The faithle  flatterer Hope whose pencil  gay  Pourtrays some vision of delight  Then bids the fairy tablet fade away   While in dire contrast  to mine eyes  Thy phantoms  yet more hideous  rise  And Memory draws from Pleasure wither flower  Corrosives for the heart of fatal power  I bid the traitor Love  adieu   Who to this fond believing bosom came  A guest insidious and untrue  With Pity foothing voice in Friendship name   The wounds he gave  nor Time shall cure  Nor Reason teach me to endure  And to that breast mild Patience pleads in vain  Which feels the curse of meriting its pain  Yet not to me  tremendous Power  Thy worst of spirit wounding pangs impart  With which  in dark conviction hour  Thou strikest the guilty unrepentant heart But of illusion long the sport  That dreary  tranquil gloom I court  Where my past errors I may still deplore  And dream of long lost happine  no more   To thee I give this tortured breast  Where Hope arises but to foster pain   Ah  lull its agonies to rest  Ah  let me never be deceived again  Behold  in long array  the woes Of the dread future  calm and undismay  Till I may claim the hope that shall not fade
