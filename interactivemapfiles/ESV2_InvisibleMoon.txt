DARK and concealed art thou   soft Evening Queen  
And Melancholy votaries that delight
To watch thee   gliding thro   the blue serene  
Now vainly seek thee on the brow of night  
Mild sorrow   such as Hope has not forsook  
May love to muse beneath thy silent reign   
But I prefer from some steep rock to look
On the obscure and fluctuating main  
What time the martial star with lurid glare  
Portentous   gleams above the troubled deep  
Or the red comet shakes his blazing hair   
Or on the fire  tinged waves the lightnings leap   
While thy fair beams illume another sky  
And shine for beings less accurst than I
