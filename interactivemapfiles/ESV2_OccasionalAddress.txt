WHEN in a thousand swarms   the summer over  
The birds of passage quit our English shore  
By various routs the feathered myriad moves   
The Becca  Fica seeks Italian groves  
No more a Wheat  ear   while the soaring files
Of fea  fowl gather round the Hebrid  isles  
But if by bird  lime touched   unplumed   confined  
some poor ill  fated   straggler stays behind  
Driven from his transient perch   beneath your eaves
On his unsheltered head the tempest raves  
While drooping round   redoubling every pain  
His Mate and Nestlings ask his help in vain  

so we   the buskin and the sock who wear  
And   strut and fret     our little season here  
Dismissed at length   as Fortune bids divide
some   lucky rogues      fit down on Thames side   
Others to Liffy western banks proceed  
And some  driven far a  field   across the Tweed  

But   pinioned here   alas    I cannot fly   
The hapless   unplumed   lingering straggler I   
Unless the healing pity you bestow  
shall imp my shattered wings  and let me go  
Hard is his fate   whom evil stars have led
To seek in scenic art precarious bread  
While still   thro   wild vicissitudes afloat  
An Hero now   and now a sans Culotte   
That eleemosinary bread he gains
Mingling with real distresses    mimic pains  

see in our group   a pale   lank Falstaff stare  
Much needs he stuffing        while young Ammon there
Rehearses    in a garret  ten feet square   
And as his soft statira sighs consent  
Roxana comes not  but a dun for rent   
Here shiveing Edgar   in his blanket rollid  
Exclaims    with too much reason      Tom a  cold      
And vainly tries his sorrows to divert  
While Goneril or Regan  wash his shirt   
  a mutt
Lo   fresh from Calais   Edward    mighty king  
Revolves  a mutÄ¾on chop upon a string  
And Hotspur   plucking    honour from the moon       
Feeds a fick infant with a pewter spoon   
More bleft the Fisher   who undaunted braves
In his small bark   the impetuous winds and waves  

For though he plough the sea when others sleep  
He draws   like Glendower   spirits from the deep   
And while the storm howls round   amidst his trouble  
Bright moonshine still illuminates the cobble   
Pale with her fears for him   some fair Poissarde  
Watches his nearing boat    with fond regard
smiles when she sees his little canvass handing  
And clasps her dripping lover on his landing  
More blest the Peasant   who   with nervous toil
Hews the rough oak   or breaks the stubborn foil   
Weary   indeed   he sees the evening come  
But then   the rude   yet tranquil hut   his home  
Receives its rustic inmate   then are his  
secure repose   and dear domestic bliss  
The orchard blushing fruit   the garden store  
The pendant hop   that mantles round the door  

Are his     and while the cheerful faggots burn  
   His lisping children hail their fire  return     
But wandering Players      unhoufeld   unannealed    
And unappointed   scour life  common field  
A flying squadron     disappointments cross   em  
And the campaign concludes   perhaps   at Horsham  
Oh   ye   whose timely bounty deigns to shed
Compassion  balm upon my luckless head  
Benevolence   with warm and glowing breast  
And soft   celestial mercy   doubly blest   
smile on the generous at    where means are given  
To aid the wretchedis to merit Heaven
