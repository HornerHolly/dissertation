FALL   dews of Heaven   upon my burning breast  
Bathe with cool drops these ever  streaming eyes   
Ye gentle Winds   that fan the balmy West  
With the soft rippling tide of morning rise  
And calm my bursting heart   as here I keep
The vigil of the wretched Now away
Fade the pale stars   as wavering over the deep
soft rosy tints announce another day  
The day of Middle summer       Ah   in vain
To those who mourn like me   does radiant June
Lead on her fragrant hours   for hopeless pain
Darkens with sullen clouds the sun of Noon  
And veiled in shadows Nature face appears
To hearts overwhelmed with grief   to eyes suffused with
tears
