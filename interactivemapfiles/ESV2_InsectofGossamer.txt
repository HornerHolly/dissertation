sMALL   viewless Æronaut   that by the line
Of Gossamer suspended   in mid air
Float  st on a fun beam  Living Atom   where
Ends thy breeze  guided voyage     with what design
In Æther dost thou launch thy form minute  
Mocking the eye       Alas   before the veil
Of denser clouds shall hide thee   the pursuit
Of the keen swift may end thy fairy fail  
Thus on the golden thread that Fancy weaves
Buoyant   as Hope illusive flattery breathes  
The young and visionary Poet leaves
Life dull realities   while sevenfold wreaths
Of rainbow  light around his head revolve  
Ah   soon at sorrow touch the radiant dreams dissolve
