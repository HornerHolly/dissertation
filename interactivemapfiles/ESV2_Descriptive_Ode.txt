CHAOTIC pile of barren stone  
That Nature hurrying hand has thrown  
Half finished   from the troubled waves  
On whose rude brow the rifted tower
Haş frowned   thro   many a stormy hour  
On this drear site of tempest  beaten graves  

sure Desolation loves to shroud
His giant form within the cloud
That hovers round thy rugged head   
And as thro   broken vaults beneath   
The future storms low  muttering breathe  
Hears the complaining voices of the dead  

Here marks the Fiend with eager eyes  
Far out at sea the fogs arise
That dimly shade the beaconed strand  
And listens the portentous roár
Of sullen waves   as on the shore  
Monotonous   they burst and tell the storm at hand    

Northward the Demon eyes are caft        
over yonder bare and sterile waste   
Where   born to hew and heave the block   sinj
Man   loft in ignorance and toil  
Becomes associate to the soil                   
And his heart hardens like his native rock  

On the bleak hills   with flint overspread  
No blossoms rear the purple head        
No shrub perfumes the Zephyrs   breath  
But over the cold and cheerless down  


Grim Desolation seems to frown    
 Blasting the ungrateful soil with partial death

Here the scathed trees with leaves half  drest  
shade no soft songster secret nest  
Whose spring  notes soothe the penfive ear   
But high the croaking cormorant flies  
And mews and hawks with clamorous cries
Tire the lone echos of these caverns drear  
Perchance among the ruins grey
some widowed mourner loves to stray  
Marking the melancholy main
Where once   afar she could discern
over the white waves his fail return
Who never   never now   returns again  

On these lone tombs   by storms up  torn   
The hopeless wretch may lingering  móurn        
Till from the ocean   rising red  
The misty Moon with lurid ray  
Lights her   reluctant   on her way  
To steep in tears her solitary bed  

Hence the dire spirit oft furveys
The ship   that to the western bays
With favouring gales pursues its course          
Then calls the vapour dark that blinds
The pilot  calls the felon winds  
That heave the billows with resifless force  

Commixing with the blotted skies  
High and more high the wild waves rise  
Till   as impetuous torrents urge  
Driven on yon fatal bank accurst  
The vessel   massy timbers burst  
And the crew sinks beneath the infuriate surge  
There find the weak an early grave  
While youthful strength the whelming wave
Repels   and labouring for the land  
With shortened breath and upturned eyes  
sees the rough shore above him rise  
Nor dreams that rapine meets him on the strand  

And are there then in human form
Monsters more favage than the storm  
Who from the gasping sufferer tear
The dripping weed     who dare to reap
The inhuman harvest of the deep  
From half  drowned victims whom the tempests spare   
Ah   yes    by avarice once poffeft     
No pity moves the rustic breast  
Callous he proves  as those who haply wait
Till I   a pilgrim weary worn  
To my own native land return  
With legal toils to drag me to my fate
