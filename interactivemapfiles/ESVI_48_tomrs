 No more my wearied soul attempts to stray From sad reality and vain regret  Nor courts enchanting fi tion to allay Sorrows that sense refuses to forget   For of calamity so long the prey  Imagination now has lost her powers  Nor will her fairy loom again e ay To dre  affliction in a robe of flowers  But if no more the bowers of Fancy bloom  Let one superior scene attract my view  Where Heaven pure rays the sacred spot illume  Let thy loved hand with palm and amaranth strew The mournful path approaching to the tomb  While Faith consoling voice endears the friendly gloom
