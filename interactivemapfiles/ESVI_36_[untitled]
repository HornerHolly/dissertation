 SHOULD the lone Wanderer  fainting on his way  Rest for a moment of the sultry hours  And tho  his path thro  thorns and roughne  lay  Pluck the wild rose  or woodbine gadding flowers  Weaving gay wreaths beneath fome sheltering tree  The sense of sorrow he awhile may lose   So have I sought thy flowers  fair Poesy  So charm my way with Friendship and the Muse  But darker now grows life unhappy day  Dark with new clouds of evil yet to come  Her pencil fickening Fancy throws away  And weary Hope reclines upon the tomb   And points my wishes to that tranquil shore  Where the pale spectre Care pursues no more
