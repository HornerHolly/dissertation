THE trees have now hid at the edge of the hurst
The spot where the ruins decay
Of the cottage   where Will of the Woodland was nursed
And lived so beloved   till the moment accurft
When he went from the woodland away  
Among all the lads of the plough or the fold  
Best esteemed by the sober and good  
Was Will of the Woodlands    and often the old
Would tell of his frolics   for active and bold
Was William the Boy of the wood  
Yet gentle was he   as the breath of the May  
And when fick and declining was laid
The Woodman his father   young William away
Would go to the forest to labour all day          
And perform his hard task in his stead  
And when his poor father the forester died  
And his mother was sad   and alone  
He toiled from the dawn   and at evening he hied
In storm or in snow   or whatever might betide  
To supply all her wants from the town  

One neighbour they had on the heath to the west  
And no other the cottage was near  
But she would send Phæbe   the child she loved best  
To stay with the widow   thus fad and diftrest  
Her hours of dejection to cheer  
As the buds of wild roses   the cheeks of the maid
Were just tinted with youth lovely hue  
Her form like the aspen   wild graces displayed  
And the eyes   over which her luxuriant locks strayed  
As the skies of the summer were blue   

still labouring to live   yet reflecting the while       
Young William considered his lot           
  Twas hard   yet    twas honest    and one tender smile
From Phoebe at night overpaid every toil  
And then all his fatigues were forgot  
    
By the brook where it glides thro   the copse of Arbeal     
When to eat his cold fare he reclined  
Then soft from her home his fweet Phoebe would steal
And bring him wood  strawberries to finish his meal  
And would fit by his fide while he dined  

And tho   when employed in the deep forest glade     
His days have seemed slowly to move  
Yet Phæbe going home   thro   the wood  walk has strayed
To bid him good night     and whatever she said   
Was more sweet than the voice of the dove  
Fair Hope   that the lover so fondly believes  
Then repeated each soul  soothing speech  
And touched with illusion   that often deceives
The future with light    as the sun thro   the leaves
Illumines the boughs of the beech  

  
But once more the tempests of chill Winter blow  
To depress and disfigure the earth           
And now ere the dawn   the young Woodman must go
To his work in the forest   half buried in snow     
And at night bring home wood for the hearth  
The bridge on the heath by the flood was washed down  
And fast fell the sleet and the rain  
The stream to a wild rapid river was grown  
And long might the widow sit fighing alone
Ere sweet Phoebe could see her again  

At the town was a market    and now for supplies
such as needed her humble abode  
Young William went forth   and his mother with sighs
Watched long at the window   with tears in her eyes  
Till he turned thro   the fields   to the road  
Then darkness came on    and she heard with affright
The wind every moment more high  
she looked from the door   not a star lent its light  
But the tempest redoubled the gloom of the night  
And the rain poured in sheets from the sky  

The clock in her cottage now mournfully told
The hours that went heavily on     
  Twas midnight    her spirits funk hopeless and cold  
And it seemed as each blast of wind fearfully told
That long   long would her William be gone  
Then heart  fick and cold to her fad bed she crept  
Yet first made up the fire in the room
To guide his dark steps    but she listened and wept  
Or if for a moment forgetful she slept  
soon she started     and thought he was come  

  Twas morn   and the wind with an hoarse sullen moan
Now seemed dying away in the wood  
When the poor wretched mother still drooping   alone     
Beheld on the threshold a figure unknown  
In gorgeous apparel who stood  
 Your son is a soldier     abruptly cried he  
   And a place in our corps has obtained  
   Nay   be not cast down    you perhaps may soon see
 Your William a captain   he now sends by me
   The purse he already has gained    

so William entrapped   twixt persuasion and force  
Is embarked for the isles of the West  
But he seemed to begin with ill omens his course  
And felt recollection   regret   and remorse
Continually weigh on his breast  
With useless repentance he eagerly eyed
The high coast as it faded from view  
And saw the green hills   on whose northernmost side
Was his own sylvan home   and he faltered and cried
   Adieu    ah    for ever adieu               

 Who now   my poor mother   thy life shall sustain  
 since thy fon has thus left thee forlorn   
Ah   canst thou forgive me   And not in the pain
Of this cruel desertion   of William complain  
   And lament that he ever was born   
   sweet Phoebe     if ever thy lover was dear  
   Now forsake not the cottage of woe  
   But comfort my mother   and quiet her fear  
   And help her to dry up the vain fruitless tear
   That too long for my absence will flow  

Yet what if my Phæbe another should wed  
 And lament her loft William no more     
The thought was too cruel    and anguish now sped
The dart of disease  
With the brave numerous dead
He has fallen on the plague  tainted shore  
In the lone village church  yard   the chancel  wall near  
High grass now waves over the spot  
Where the mother of William   unable to bear
His loss   who to her widowed heart was so dear  
Has both him and her sorrows forgot  

By the brook where it winds thro   the wood of Arbeal  
Or amid the deep forest   to moan     
The poor wandering Phæbe will silently steal   
The pain of her bosom no reason can heal  
And she loves to indulge it alone  

Her senses are injured   her eyes dim with tears   
she sits by the river and weaves
Reed garlands   against her dear William appears  
Then breathlessly listens   and fancies she hears
His step in the half  withered leaves  

Ah   such are the miseries to which ye give birth  
Ye statesmen   ne  er dreading a scar  
Who from pictured saloon   or the bright sculptured hearth
Disperse desolation and death thro   the earth  
When ye let loose the demons of war
