OF Folly weary   shrinking from the view
Of Violence and Fraud   allowed to take
All peace from humble life    I would forsake
Their haunts for ever   and   sweet Nymph   with you
Find shelter   where my tired   and tear  swoln eyes
Among your filent shades of soothing hue  
Your    bells and florets of unnumbered dyes  
Might rest  And learn the bright varieties
That from your lovely hands are fed with dew  
And every veined leaf   that trembling sighs
In mead or woodland    or in wilds remote  
Or lurk with mosses in the humid caves  
Mantle the cliffs   on dimpling rivers float   
Or stream from coral rocks beneath the Ocean waves
