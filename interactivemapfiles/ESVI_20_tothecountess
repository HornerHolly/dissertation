On this blest day may no dark cloud  or shower  With envious shade the Sun bright influence hide   But all his rays illume the favour hour  That saw thee  Mary    Henry lovely bride  With years revolving may it still arise  Bleft with each good approving Heaven can send   And still  with ray serene  shall those blue eyes Enchant the husband  and attach the friend   For you fair Friendship  amaranth shall blow  And Love own thornle  roses bind your brow  And when long hence to happier worlds you go  Your beauteous race shall be what you are now  And future Nevills thro  long ages shine  With hearts as good  and forms as fair as thine
