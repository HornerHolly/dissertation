OvERWHELMeD with sorrow  and sustaining long   The proud man contumely  th  oppre or wrong   Languid despondency  and vain regret  Must my exhausted spirit struggle yet   Yes   Robb myself of all that fortune gave  Even of all hope but shelter in the grave  Still shall the plaintive lyre e ay its powers To dre  the cave of Care with Fancy flowers  Maternal Love the fiend Despair withstand  Still animate the heart and guide the hand   May you  dear objects of my anxious care  Escape the evils I was born to bear  Round my devoted head while tempests roll  Yet there  where I have treasured up my soul May the soft rays of dawning hope impart Reviving Patience to my fainting heart    And when its sharp solicitudes shall cease  May I be conscious in the realms of peace That every tear which swells my children eyes  From sorrows past  not present ills arise  Then  with some friend who loves to share your pain  For  tis my boast that fome such friends remain  By filial grief  and fond remembrance prest  You ll seek the spot where all my sorrows reft   Recal my haple  days in fad review  The long calamities I bore for you  And with an happier fate resolve to prove How well you merited your mother love
