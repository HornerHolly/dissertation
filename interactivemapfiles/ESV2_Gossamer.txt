OVER faded heath  flowers spun   or thorny furze  
The filmy Gossamer is lightly spread   
Waving in every sighing air that stirs  
As Fairy fingers had entwined the thread   
A thousand trembling orbs of lucid dew
spangle the texture of the fairy loom  
As if soft sylphs   lamenting as they flew  
Had wept departed summer  transient bloom  
But the wind rises   and the turf receives
The glittering web     so   evanescent   fade
Bright views that Youth with fanguine heart   believes   
so vanish schemes of bliss   by Fancy made   
Which   fragile as the fleeting dreams of morn  
Leave but the withered heath   and barren thorn
