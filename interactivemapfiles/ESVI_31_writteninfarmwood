 SPRING dewy hand on this fair summit weaves The downy gra   with tufts of Alpine flowers  And shades the beechen slopes with tender leaves  And leads the shepherd to his upland bowers  Strewn with wild thyme  while flow descending showers Feed the green ear  and nurse the future sheaves    Ah  blest the hind whom no fad thought bereaves Of the gay Season pleasures     All his hours To wholesome labour given  or thoughtle  mirth     No pangs of sorrow past  or coming dread  Bend his unconscious spirit down to earth  Or chase calm flumbers from his carele  head   Ah  what to me can those dear days restore  When scenes could charm that now I taste no more
