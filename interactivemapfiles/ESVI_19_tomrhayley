FOR me the Muse a simple band design Of idle  flowers that bloom the woods among  Which  with the cypre  and the willow join  A garland form as artle  as my song  And little dared I hope its transient hours So long would last  composed of buds so brief   Till Hayley hand among the vagrant flowers  Threw from his verdant crown a deathle  leaf  For high in Fame bright fane has Judgment placed The laurel wreath Serena poet won  Which  woven with myrtles by the hands of Taste  The Mufe decreed for this her favourite son  And those immortal leaves his temples shade  Whose fair  eternal verdure   shall not fade
