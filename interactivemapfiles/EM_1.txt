sLOW in the Wintry Morn  the struggling light Throws a faint gleam upon the troubled waves  Their foaming tops  as they approach the shore And the broad surf that never ceasing breaks On the innumerous pebbles  catch the beams Of the pale sun  that with reluctance gives To this cold northern Isle  its shortened day  Alas  how few the morning wakes to joy  How many murmur at oblivious night For leaving them so soon  for bearing thus  Their fancied bliss  the only bliss they taste    On her black wings away   Changing the dreams That soothed their sorrows  for calamities  And every day brings its own sad proportion  For doubts  diseases  abjećt dread of Death  And faithless friends  and fame and fortune lost  Fancied or real wants  and wounded pride  That views the day star  but to curse his beams  Yet He  whose spirit into being called This wond rous World of Waters  He who bids The wild wind lift them till they dash the clouds  And speaks to them in thunder  or whose breath  Low murmuring over the gently heaving tides  When the fair Moon  in summer night serene  Irradiates with long trembling lines of light Their undulating surface  that great Power   Who  governing the Planets  also knows If but a sea Mew falls  whose nest is hid In these incumbent cliffs  He surely means To us  his reasoning Creatures  whom He bids Acknowledge and revere his awful hand  Nothing but good  Yet Man  misguided Man  Mars the fair work that he was bid enjoy  And makes himself the evil he deplores  How often  when my weary soul recoils From proud oppression  and from legal crimes  For such are in this Land  where the vain boast Of equal Law is mockery  while the cost Of seeking for redress is sure to plunge Th  already injured to more certain ruin And the wretch starves  before his Counsel pleads  How often do I half abjure society  And figh for some lone Cottage  deep embowered In the green woods  that these steep chalky Hills Guard from the strong south West  where round their base The Beach wide flourishes  and the light Ash With slender leaf half hides the thymy turf 1  There do I wish to hide me  well COntent If on the short grass  strewn with fairy flowers  I might repose thus sheltered   or when Eve In Orient crimson lingers in the west  Gain the high mound  and mark these waves remote  Lucid tho  distant   blushing with the rays Of the far flaming Orb  that sinks beneath them  For I have thought  that I should then behold The beauteous works of God  unspoiled by Man And less affected then  by human woes I witnessed not  might better learn to bear Those that injustice  and duplicity And faithlessness and folly  fix on me  For never yet could I derive relief  When my swollen heart was bursting with its sorrows  From the sad thought  that others like myself Live but to swell affidions countless tribes |  Tranquil advion I have vainly sought  Peace  who delights in solitary shade  No more will spread for me her downy wings  But  like the fabled Danaids or the wretch  Who ceaseless  up the steep acclivity  Was doomed to heave the still rebounding rock  Onward I labour  as the baffled wave  Which yon rough beach repulses  that returns With the next breath of wind  to fail again   Ah  Mourner cease these wailings  cease and learn That not the Cot sequestered  where the briar And wood bine wild  embrace the mossy thatch   scarce seen amid the forest gloom obscure   Or more substantial farm  well fenced and warm  Where the full barn  and cattle foddered round speak rustic plenty  nor the statelier dome By dark firs shaded  or the aspiring pine  Close by the village Church  with care concealed By verdant foliage  lest the poor mans grave should mar the smiling prospect of his Lord   Where offices well ranged  or dove cote stocked  Declare manorial residence  not these Or any of the buildings  new and trim With windows circling towards the restless sea  Which ranged in rows  now terminate my walk  Can shut out for an hour the spectre Care  That from the dawn of reason  follows still Unhappy Mortals   till the friendly grave  Our sole secure asylum   ends the chace   Behold  in witness of this mournful truth  A group approach me  whose deječted looks  sad Heralds of distress proclaim them Men Banish d for ever and for conscience sake From their distraćted Country  whence the name Of Freedom misapplied  and much abus d By lawless Amºy  has driven them far To wander  with the prejudice they learned From Bigotry  the Tutouress of the blind   Thro  the wide World unsheltered  their sole hope  That German spoilers  thro  that pleasant land May carry wide the desolating scourge Of War and Vengeance  yet unhappy Men  Whatever your errors  I lament your fate  And  as disconsolate and sad ye hang Upon the barrier of the rock  and seem To murmur your despondence  waiting long some fortunate reverse that never comes  Methinks in each expressive face  I see Diminated arguin   there droops one  Who in a moping cloister long consumed This life ina tive  to obtain a better  And thought that meagre abstinence  to wake From his hard pallet with the midnight bell  To live on eleemosynary bread  And to renounce God works  would please that God  And now the poor pale wretch receives  amazed  The pity  strangers give to his distress  Because these strangers are  by his dark creed  Condemned as Heretics and with sick heart Regrets his pious prison  and his beads   Another  of more haughty port  declines The aid he needs not  while in mute despair His high indignant thoughts go back to France  Dwelling on all he lost the Gothic dome  That vied with splendid palaces   the beds Of silk and down  the filver chalices  Westments with gold enwrought for blazing altars  Where  amid clouds of incense  he held forth To kneeling crowds the imaginary bones Of saints supposed  in pearl and gold enchased  And still with more than living Monarchs  pomp surrounded   was believed by mumbling bigot  To hold the keys of Heaven  and to admit Whom he thought good to share it Now alas    He  to whose daring soul and high ambition The World seemed circumscribed  who  wont to dream  Of Fleuri  Richelieu  Alberoni  men Who trod on Empire  and whose politics Were not beyond the grasp of his vast mind  Is  in a Land once hostile  still prophaned By disbelief  and rites un orthodox  The object of compassion At his fide  Lighter of heart than these  but heavier far Than he was wont  another vićtim comes  An Abbé who with less contračted brow still smiles and flatters  and still talks of Hope  Which  sanguine as he is  he does not feel  And so he cheats the sad and weighty pressure still  as Men misled Of evils present  By early prejudice  so hard to break   I mourn your sorrows  for I too have known Involuntary exile  and while yet England had charms for me  have felt how sad It is to look across the dim cold sea  That melancholy rolls it  refluent tides Between us and the dear regretted land we call our own as now ye pensive wait On this bleak morning  gazing on the waves That seem to leave your shore  from whence the wind Is loaded to your ears  with the deep groans Of martyred saints and suffering Royalty  While to your eyes the avenging power of Heaven Appears in aweful anger to prepare The storm of vengeance  fraught with plagues and death  Even he of milder heart  who was indeed The fimple shepherd in a rustic scene  And   mid the vine clad hills of Languedoc  Taught to the bare foot peasant  whose hard hands Produced   the nećtar he could seldom taste  submission to the Lord for whom he toiled  He  or his brethren  who to Neustria sons Enforced religious patience  when  at times  On their indignant hearts Power iron hand Too strongly struck  eliciting some sparks Of the bold spirit of their native North  Even these Parochial Priests  these humbled men  Whose lowly undistinguished cottages Witnessed a life of purest piety  While the meek tenants were  perhaps  unknown Each to the haughty Lord of his domain  Who marked them not  the Noble scorning still The poor and pious Priest  as with slow pace He glided thro  the dim arched avenue which to the castle led  hoping to cheer The last sad hour of some laborious life That hasten d to its close even such a Man Becomes an exile  staying not to try By temperate zeal to check his maddening flock  Who  at the novel sound of Liberty  Ah most intoxicating sound to slaves    start into licence Lo  dejećted now  The wandering Pastor mourns  with bleeding heart  His erring people  weeps and prays for them  And trembles for the account that he must give To Heaven for souls entrusted to his care   Where the cliff  hollowed by the wintry storm  Affords a seat with matted sea weed strewn  A softer form reclines  around her run  On the rough shingles  or the chalky bourn  Her gay unconscious children  soon amused   Who pick the fretted stone  or glossy shell  Or crimson plant marine  or they contrive The fairy vessel  with its ribband sail And gilded paper pennant  in the pool  Left by the salt wave on the yielding sands  They launch the mimic navy Happy age 1 Unmindful of the milk  of Man l  Alas   too long a vićtim to distress  Their Mother  lost in melancholy thought  Lulled for a moment by the murmurs low   Of sullen billows  wearied by the task Of having here  with swollen and aching eyes Fixed on the grey horizon  since the dawn solicitously watched the weekly sail From her dear native land  now yields awhile To kind forgetfulness  while Fancy brings  In waking dreams  that native land again Versailles appears its painted galleries  And rooms of regal splendour  rich with gold  Where  by long mirrors multiplyed  the crowd Paid willing homage and  united there  Beauty gave charms to empire Ah   too soon From the gay visionary pageant roused  see the sad mourner start l and  drooping  look With tearful eyes and heaving bosom round On drear reality where dark ning waves  Urged by the rising wind  unheeded foam Near her cold rugged seat  To call her thence A fellow sufferer comes  dejećtion deep Checks  but conceals not quite  the martial air  And  that high consciousness of noble blood  Which he has learned from infancy to think Exalts him over the race of common men  Nursed in the velvet lap of luxury  And fed by adulation could be learn  That worth alone is true Nobility And that the peasant who    amid   the sons  Of Reason  Valour  Liberty  and Virtue    Displays distinguished merit  is a Noble  Of Nature own creation    If even here  If in this land of highly vaunted Freedom  Even Britons controvert the unwelcome truth  Can it be relished by the sons of France Men  who derive their boasted ancestry From the fierce leaders of religious wars  The first in Chivalry emblazoned page  Who Who reckon Gueslin  Bayard  or De Foix  Among their brave Progenitors   Their eyes  Accustomed to regard the splendid trophies of Heraldry  that with fantastic hand Mingles  like images in feverish dreams   Gorgons and Hydras  and Chimeras dire   With painted puns  and visionary shapes    see not the fimple dignity of Virtue  But hold all base  whom honours such as these Exalt not from the crowd  As one  who long Has dwelt amid the artificial scenes Of populous City  deems that splendid shows  The Theatre  and pageant pomp of Courts  Are only worth regard  forgets all taste For Nature genuine beauty  in the lapse Of gushing waters hears no soothing sound Nor listens with delight to fighing winds  That  on their fragrant pinions  waft the notes Of birds rejoicing in the tranged copse  Nor gazes pleased on Ocean filver breast  While lightly over it sails the summer clouds Refle ted in the wave  that  hardly heard  Flows on the yellow sands  so to his mind  That long has lived where Despotism hides His features harsh  beneath the diadem   Of worldly grandeur  abjećt slavery seems  If by that power imposed  slavery no more  For luxury wreathes with silk the iron bonds  And hides the ugly rivets with her flowers  Till the degenerate triflers  while they love The glitter of the chains  forget their weight  But more the Men   whose ill acquired wealth Was wrung from plundered myriads  by the means Too often legalized by power abused  Feel all the horrors of the fatal change  When their ephemeral greatness  marred at once  As a vain toy that Fortune childish hand Equally joyed to fashion or to crush   Leaves them exposed to universal scorn For having nothing else  not even the claim To honour  which respect for Heroes past Allows to ancient titles  Men  like these  sink even beneath the level  whence base arts Alone had raised them  unlamented fink  And know that they deserve the woes they feel  Poor wandering wretches whosoever ye are  That hopeless  houseless  friendless  travel wide Over these bleak russet downs  where  dimly seen The solitary shepherd shivering tends His dun discoloured flock  shepherd  unlike Him  whom in song the Poet fancy crowns With garlands  and his crook with villets binds   Poor vagrant wretches outcasts of the world   Whom no abode receives  no parish owns  Roving  like Nature commoners  the land That boasts such general plenty  if the fight  Of wide extended misery softens yours Awhile  suspend your murmurs l here behold The strange vicissitudes of fate while thus The exiled Nobles  from their country driven  Whose richest luxuries were theirs  must feel More poignant anguish  than the lowest poor  Who  born to indigence  have learned to brave Rigid Adversity depressing breath Ah  rather Fortune worthless favourites | Who feed on England vitals Pensioners Of base corruption  who  in quick ascent To opulence unmerited  become Giddy with pride  and as ye rise  forgetting The dust ye lately left  with scorn look down On those beneath ye  tho  your equals once In fortune  and in worth superior still  They view the eminence  on which ye stand  With wonder  not with envy  for they know The means  by which ye reached it  have been such As  in all honest eyes  degrade ye far Beneath the poor dependent  whose sad heart Reluctant pleads for what your pride denies   Ye venal  worthless hirelings of a Court Ye pampera Parafites  whom Britons pay For forging fetters for them  rather here study a lesson that concerns ye much   And  trembling  learn  that if oppressed too long  The aging mutuº  to madness stung  will turn on their oppressors  and  no more By sounding titles and parading forms Bound like tame vićtims  will redress themselves   Then swept away by the refistless torrent  Not only all your pomp may disappear  But  in the tempest lost  fair Order fink Her decent head  and lawless Anarchy Overturn celestial Freedom radiant throne    As now in Gallia   where Confusion  born Of party rage and selfish love of rule  sully the noblest cause that ever warmed The heart of Patriot Virtue   There arise A  The infernal passions  Vengeance  seeking blood  And Avarice  and Envy harpy fangs Pollute the immortal shrine of Liberty  Dismay her votaries  and disgrace her name  Respect is due to principle  and they  Who suffer for their conscience  have a claim  Whatever that principle may be  to praise  These ill starred Exiles then  who  bound by ties    To them the bonds of honour  who resigned Their country to preserve them  and now seek In England an asylum well deserve To find that  every prejudice forgot  Which pride and ignorance teaches   we for them Feel as our brethren  and that English hearts  Of just compassion ever own the sway  As truly as our element  the deep   Obeys the mild dominion of the Moon  This they have found  and may they find it still   Thus mayst thou  Britain  triumph   May thy foes  By Reason generous potency subdued  Learn  that the God thou worshippest  delights In acts of pure humanity May thine Be still such bloodless laurels nobler far Than those acquired at Cressy or Poićtiers  Or of more recent growth  those well bestowed On him who stood on Calpe blazing height Amid the thunder of a warring world  Illustrious rather from the crowds he saved From flood and fire  than from the ranks who fell Beneath his valour   Actions such as these  Like incense rising to the Throne of Heaven  Far better justify the pride  that swells  In British bosoms  than the deafening roar Of Victory from a thousand brazen throats  That tell with what success wide wasting War Has by our brave Compatriots thinned the world
