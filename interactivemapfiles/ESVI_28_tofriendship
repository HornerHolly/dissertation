 THOU  whose name too often is profaned   Whose charms  celestial  few have hearts to feel   Unknown to Folly and by Pride disdain   To thy soft solace may my sorrows steal   Like the fair Moon  thy mild and genuine ray Thro  life long evening shall unclouded last  While pleasure frail attachments fleet away  As fades the rainbow from the northern blast   Tis thine  O Nymph  with   balmy hands to bind  The wounds inflicted in misfortune storm  And blunt severe affliction sharpelt dart    Tis thy pure spirit warms my Anna  mind  Beams thro  the pensive softne  of her form  And holds its altar on her spotle  heart
