LOOSE to the wind her golden tre es stream  Forming bright waves with amorous Zephyr sighs   And tho  averted now  her charming eyes Then with warm love  and melting pity beam  That fine fuffusion on thy cheek was love   What wonder then those beauteous tints should move  Should fire this heart  this tender heart of mine   Thy soft melodious voice  thy air  thy shape  Were of a godde  not a mortal maid   Yet tho  thy charms  thy heavenly charms should fade  My heart  my tender heart could not escape   Nor cure for me in time or change be found
